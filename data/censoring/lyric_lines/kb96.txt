i
got
this
feeling
inside
my
bones
it
goes
electric
wavy
when
turn
on
all through my
city
all through
home
were
flying
up
no ceiling
we
in
our
zone
that
sunshine
pocket
good
soul
feet
feel
hot
blood
body
drops
ooh
cant
take
eyes
up
off
it
moving
so
phenomenally
room
lock
the
way
rock
dont
stop
and
under
lights
everything
nowhere
to
hide
im
dancing
you
close
move
well
already
know
just
imagine
imagine
nothing
can
see
but
dance
dance
a
good
here
with
come
all
those
things
saying
aint
nobody
leaving
soon
keep
ooh
its
something
magical
air
blood
rushing
need
no
reason
control
fly
high
ceiling
cause
the
i
feeling
everybody
now
body
