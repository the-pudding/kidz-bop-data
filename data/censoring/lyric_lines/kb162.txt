you
you
got
me
thinking
itll
be
alright
told
me
"come
and
take
a
look
inside"
believed
in
every
single
lie
but
i
i
failed
this
time
it
feels
like
tonight
cant
believe
im
broken
inside
see
that
theres
nothing
wanna
do
try
to
make
up
you
tonight
was
waiting
for
the
day
youd
come
around
chasing
all
found
from
moment
came
into
my
life
showed
whats
right
never
felt
before
just
when
leave
back
more
else
here
seems
matter
oh
these
ever
changing
days
youre
one
thing
remains
could
stay
forever
