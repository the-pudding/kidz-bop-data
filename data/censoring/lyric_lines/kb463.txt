i
was
lying
on
the
grass
of
sunday
morning
last
week
indulging
in
my
self-defeat
mind
thugged
all
laced
and
bugged
twisted
wrong
beat
a
comfortable
three
feet
deep
now
fuzzy
stare
from
not
being
there
confusing
impaired
tribal
lunar
speak
course
you
cant
become
if
only
say
what
would
have
done
so
missed
million
miles
fun
know
itâ€™s
up
for
me
if
steal
sunshine
making
sure
im
too
keeping
versed
frying
bench
slide
park
across
street
l-a-t-e-r
that
sticky
paws
were
into
straws
out
big
fat
slurpy
treats
an
incredible
eight-foot
heap
funny
glare
to
pay
gleaming
tare
staring
under
heat
involved
usual
feat
among
but
invite
who
want
come
its
some
hard
see
dumb
built
sunshine
sunshine
