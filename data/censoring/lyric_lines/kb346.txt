im
so
tired
of
being
here
suppressed
by
all
my
childish
fears
and
if
you
have
to
leave
i
wish
that
would
just
leave
cause
your
presence
still
lingers
here
it
wont
me
alone
these
wounds
seem
heal
this
pain
is
too
real
theres
much
time
cannot
erase
when
cried
id
wipe
away
tears
youd
scream
fight
ive
held
hand
through
years
but
used
captivate
resonating
light
now
bound
the
life
left
behind
face
haunts
once
pleasant
dreams
voice
chased
sanity
in
tried
hard
tell
myself
youre
gone
though
with
me
been
along
