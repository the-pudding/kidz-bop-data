were
driving
slow
through
the
snow
on
fifth
avenue
and
right
now
radios
all
that
we
can
hear
aint
talked
since
left
its
so
overdue
cold
outside
but
between
us
worse
in
here
world
slows
down
my
heart
beats
fast
i
know
this
is
part
where
end
starts
cant
take
it
any
longer
thought
were
stronger
do
linger
slipping
our
fingers
dont
wanna
try
thats
lefts
goodbye
to
find
a
way
tell
you
hate
just
your
tears
everyday
seven
takes
of
same
old
scene
seems
bound
by
laws
routine
gotta
talk
before
go
sleep
will
once
whats
hurting
me
youll
ask
me
hold
carry
like
nothings
wrong
there
no
more
time
for
lies
cause
see
sunset
eyes
cant
this
its
fingers
goodbye
now
oh
these
