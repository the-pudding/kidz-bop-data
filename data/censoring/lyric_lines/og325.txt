you
were
in
college
working
part-time
waiting
tables
left
a
small
town
and
never
looked
back
i
was
flight
risk
with
fear
of
falling
wondering
why
we
bother
love
if
it
lasts
say
"can
believe
it"
as
were
lying
on
the
couch
moment
could
see
yes
can
now
do
remember
sitting
there
by
water
put
your
arm
around
me
for
first
time
made
rebel
careless
mans
careful
daughter
are
best
thing
thats
ever
been
mine
flash
forward
taking
world
together
theres
drawer
my
things
at
place
learn
secrets
figure
out
im
guarded
say
well
make
parents
mistakes
but
got
bills
to
pay
nothing
figured
when
hard
take
yes
this
is
what
thought
about:
remember
all
city
lights
saw
start
that
fight
2:30
am
everything
slipping
right
our
hands
ran
out
crying
followed
into
street
braced
myself
goodbye
cause
ive
known
then
took
surprise
said
"ill
leave
alone"
"i
how
felt
water
every
look
you
its
like
fell
love
she
mine"

last
turn
