i
know
a
place
where
the
grass
is
really
greener
warm
wet
and
wild
there
must
be
something
in
water
sippin
on
juice
laying
underneath
palm
trees
undone
boys
break
their
necks
tryna
act
little
crazy
at
us
you
could
travel
world
but
nothing
comes
close
to
golden
coast
once
party
with
us
youll
falling
love
oh
oh-oh
oh-oh
california
gurls
were
unforgettable
fine
fresh
fierce
we
got
it
lock
sun-kissed
beach
so
hot
will
melt
your
popsicle
oh-oh
oh
undeniable
west
represent
now
put
hands
up
you
world
once
gurls
