my
best
friend
gave
me
the
advice
he
said
each
days
a
gift
and
not
given
right
leave
no
stone
unturned
your
fears
behind
try
to
take
path
less
traveled
by
that
first
step
you
is
longest
stride
if
today
was
last
day
tomorrow
too
late
could
say
goodbye
yesterday
would
live
moment
like
old
pictures
in
past
donate
every
dime
had
day
what
if
against
grain
should
be
way
of
life
whats
worth
price
always
fight
second
counts
cause
theres
so
youre
never
living
twice
dont
free
ride
own
last
had
call
those
friends
see
reminisce
memories
forgive
enemies
find
one
dreaming
of
swear
up
down
god
above
youd
finally
fall
love
make
mark
mending
broken
heart
know
its
shoot
for
stars
regardless
who
are
do
whatever
it
takes
cant
rewind
this
let
nothing
stand
hands
time
on
side
