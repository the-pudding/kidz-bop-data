shadows
fill
an
empty
heart
as
love
is
fading
from
all
the
things
that
we
are
but
not
saying
can
see
beyond
scars
make
it
to
dawn
change
colors
of
sky
and
open
up
ways
you
made
me
feel
alive
i
loved
for
never
died
through
night
will
find
what
about
now
today
if
youre
making
was
meant
be
our
went
away
its
lost
behind
words
could
find
baby
before
too
late
now
sun
breaking
in
your
eyes
start
a
new
day
this
broken
still
survive
with
touch
grace
fade
into
light
am
by
side
where
there
nothing
fear
right
beside
my
life
yours
