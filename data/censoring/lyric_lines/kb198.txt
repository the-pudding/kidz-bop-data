this
time
i
wonder
what
it
feels
like
to
find
the
one
in
life
we
all
dream
of
but
dreams
just
arent
enough
so
ill
be
waiting
for
real
thing
know
by
feeling
moment
when
were
meeting
will
play
out
a
scene
straight
off
silver
screen
holding
my
own
breath
right
up
til
end
until
that
spend
forever
with
cause
nobody
wants
last
there
everyone
feel
someone
cares
love
life
their
hands
theres
gotta
somebody
me
do
on
and
theyre
not
alone
else
same
somewhere
tonight
street
moonlight
you
too
its
déjà
vu
standing
here
breath
could
end
is
cant
give
up
looking
diamond
rough
never
shows
make
sure
youre
one
me
oh
