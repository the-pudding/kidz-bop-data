everybody’s
talking
but
they
don’t
say
a
thing
look
at
me
with
sad
eyes
i
want
the
sympathy
its
cool
you
didn’t
sometimes
can’t
go
back
why’d
have
to
and
make
mess
like
that
well
just
before
let
ever
been
low
had
friend
that
down
so
when
truth
came
out
were
last
know
left
in
cold
cause
what
did
was
low
no
need
your
number
there’s
nothing
except
never
thought
itd
hurt
this
much
be
saved
my
friends
are
outside
waiting
i’ve
gotta
have
been
walk
of
darkness
no
sense
regret
clear
conscience
we
both
know
heres
show
for
all
time
loved
so
