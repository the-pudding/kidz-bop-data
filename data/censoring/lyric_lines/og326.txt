somethin
to
admire
cause
your
shine
is
like
a
mirror
and
i
cant
help
but
notice
reflect
in
this
heart
of
mine
if
ever
feel
alone
the
glare
makes
me
hard
find
just
know
that
im
always
parallel
on
other
side
with
hand
my
pocket
full
soul
can
tell
theres
no
place
we
couldnt
go
put
past
here
tryna
pull
through
gotta
be
strong
dont
wanna
lose

lookin
right
at
half

as
promise

making
two
reflections
into
one

seem
merely
assembled
