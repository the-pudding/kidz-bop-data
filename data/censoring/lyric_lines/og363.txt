it
takes
fallin
in
love
with
me

need
let
take
the
night
real
easy
and
know
that
youll
still
wanna
see
on
sunday
morning
music
loud
while
moon
out
something
yououou
lit
up

wont
sleeeeeep
cause
im
lost

just
your
skin
mine
eyes
do
exploring
passion
message
when
smile
my
time
a
wonderland
might
company
tonight
