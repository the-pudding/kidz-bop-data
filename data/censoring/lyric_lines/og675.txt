now
and
then
i
think
of
when
we
were
together
like
you

felt
so
happy
could
die
told
myself
that
right
for
me
but
lonely
in
your

was

its
an
ache
still
remember
can
get
addicted
to
a
certain
kind
sadness
resignation
the

always
end
found
not
make
sense
well
would
be
friends
ill
admit
glad
it
over
didnt
have
cut
off
out
never
happened
nothing
dont
even
need
treat
stranger
feels
rough
no
stoop
low
collect
records
change
number
guess
though
youre
just
somebody
used
know
all
times
screwed
had
believing
something
id
done
wanna
live
way
reading
into
every
word
say
let
go
wouldnt
catch
hung
up
on
i
know
now
that
