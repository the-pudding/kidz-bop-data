i
am
unwritten
cant
read
my
mind
im
undefined
just
beginning
the
pens
in
hand
ending
unplanned
staring
at
blank
page
before
you
open
up
dirty
window
let
sun
illuminate
words
that
cannot
find
reaching
for
something
distance
so
close
can
almost
taste
it
release
your
inhibitions
feel
rain
on
skin
no
one
else
only
else
speak
lips
drench
yourself
unspoken
live
life
with
arms
wide
today
is
where
book
begins
rest
still
yeah
oh
oh
break
tradition
sometimes
tries
are
outside
lines
weve
been
conditioned
to
not
make
mistakes
but
way
no
unwritten
