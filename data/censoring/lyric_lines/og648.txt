sick
and
tired
of
this
world
theres
no
more
air
tripping
over
myself
going
nowhere
waiting
suffocating
direction
i
took
a
dive
and
on
the
way
down
saw
you
you
saved
me
from
wont
forget
loved
almost
fell
right
through
but
held
to
been
wondering
why
its
only
have
always
inside
waiting
breathe
alright
sunlight
my
face
wake
up
yet
im
alive
cause
was
so
afraid
under
now
weight
feels
like
nothing
down
down
down
youre
all
wanted
needed
that
wanted
now
oh
