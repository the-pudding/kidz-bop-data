dont
look
at
me
every
day
is
so
wonderful
and
suddenly
its
hard
to
breathe
now
then
i
get
insecure
from
all
the
pain
feel
ashamed
am
beautiful
no
matter
what
they
say
words
cant
bring
down
in
single
way
yes
down
oh
you
today
your
friends
youre
delirious
consumed
doom
tryin
fill
emptiness
piece
gone
left
puzzle
undone
aint
that
it
is
cause
are
we
do
no
say
were
song
thats
outta
tune
full
of
mistakes
and
everywhere
go
go
the
sun
will
always
shine
always
shine!
but
tomorrow
might
awake
on
other
side
wont
us
