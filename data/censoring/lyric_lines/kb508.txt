i
wanna
follow
where
she
goes
think
about
her
and
knows
it
let
take
control
cause
everytime
that
gets
close
yeah
pulls
me
in
enough
to
keep
guessing
maybe
should
stop
start
confessing
confessing
oh
ive
been
shaking
love
when
crazy
takes
all
my
inhibitions
baby
theres
nothing
holding
back
you
places
tear
up
reputation
manipulate
decisions
says
shes
never
afraid
just
picture
everybody
smiling
really
doesnt
like
wait
not
into
hesitation
holding-
if
we
lost
our
minds
took
way
too
far
know
wed
be
alright
would
alright
were
by
side
stumbled
the
dark
feel
so
free
youre
with
me
baby
