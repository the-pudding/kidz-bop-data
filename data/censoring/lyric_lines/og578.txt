i
will
not
make
the
same
mistakes
that
you
did
let
myself
cause
my
heart
so
much
misery
break
way
did
fell
hard
ive
learned
to
never
it
get
far
because
of
stray
too
from
sidewalk
play
on
safe
side
dont
hurt
find
trust
only
me
but
everyone
around
me
you
am
afraid
lose
and
its
long
before
point
out
cannot
cry
know
thats
weakness
in
your
eyes
im
forced
fake
a
smile
laugh
every
day
life
cant
possibly
when
wasnt
even
whole
start
with
watched
die
heard
night
sleep
was
young
should
have
known
better
than
lean
thought
anyone
else
just
saw
pain
now
middle
for
damn
thing
try
hardest
forget
everything
how
else
ashamed
empty
