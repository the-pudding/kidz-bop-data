yeah
it’s
over
i’m
circling
these
vultures
got
me
praying
man
this
hunger
and
feeling
something
rotten
last
time
i
saw
you
said
“what’s
up”
pushed
right
through
then
tried
to
catch
you
but
we’re
always
on
the
move
now
sober
symptoms
of
culture
night
ain’t
getting
younger
call’s
around
corner
kinda
tempted
pouring
out
truth
just
fading
talkers
‘cause
all
want
is
sayin’
come
over
here
sit
next
we
can
see
where
things
go
naturally
say
word
i’ll
part
sea
take
high
well
frontin
my
intention
your
man
outlined
in
chalk
its
a
midnight
intervention
no
plans
make
it
stop
wanna
keep
light
tell
not
trying
change
mind
alright
ooh
oooh
alright
so
