high
dive
into
frozen
waves
where
the
past
comes
back
to
life
fight
fear
for
selfish
pain
it
was
worth
every
time
hold
still
right
before
we
fall
cause
both
know
how
this
ends
a
clock
ticks
til
breaks
your
glass
and
im
lost
in
you
again
are
piece
of
me
i
wish
didnt
need
chasing
relentlessly
dont
why
if
our
love
is
tragedy
my
remedy
loves
insanity
clarity
heyay
heyayay
heyay
hey
walk
on
through
big
parade
refuse
make
amends
cuts
deep
ground
makes
us
forget
all
common
sense
speak
as
try
leave
what
well
choose
push
then
ill
too
