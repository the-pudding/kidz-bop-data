do
you
ever
feel
like
breaking
down
out
of
place
somehow
just
dont
belong
and
no
one
understands
you
wanna
run
away
lock
yourself
in
your
room
with
the
radio
on
turned
up
so
loud
that
hears
screaming
no
know
what
its
when
nothing
feels
alright
to
be
me
hurt
lost
left
dark
kicked
youre
down
youve
been
pushed
around
edge
ones
there
save
welcome
my
life
somebody
else
are
sick
feeling
out
desperate
find
something
more
before
is
over
stuck
inside
a
world
hate
everyone
around
their
big
fake
smiles
stupid
lies
while
deep
bleeding
lied
straight
face
stabbed
back
might
think
im
happy
but
not
gonna
okay
everybody
always
gave
wanted
never
had
work
it
was
like
what
like
