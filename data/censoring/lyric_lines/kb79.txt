grew
up
in
a
small
town
and
when
the
rain
would
fall
down
id
just
stare
out
my
window
dreaming
of
what
could
be
if
end
happy
i
pray
try
not
to
reach
but
tried
speak
felt
like
no-one
hear
me
wanted
belong
here
something
so
wrong
break
away
ill
spread
wings
learn
how
fly
do
it
takes
till
touch
sky
make
wish
take
chance
change
darkness
into
sun
wont
forget
all
ones
that
love
risk
wanna
feel
warm
breeze
sleep
under
palm
tree
rush
ocean
get
onboard
fast
train
travel
on
jetplane
away
gotta
ive
building
with
100
floors
swinging
revolving
doors
maybe
dont
know
where
theyll
keep
moving
tho
its
easy
tell
you
goodbye
place
come
from
