what
the
heart
wants
wants
wants
wants
you
got
me
sipping
on
something
i
cant
compare
to
nothing
ive
ever
known
im
hoping
that
after
this
fever
ill
survive
know
acting
a
bit
crazy
strung
out
little
hazy
hand
over
heart
praying
gonna
make
it
out
alive
beds
getting
cold
and
youre
not
here
future
we
hold
is
so
unclear
but
until
call
bet
odds
against
all
save
your
advice
cause
wont
hear
might
be
right
dont
care
theres
million
reasons
why
should
give
up
scattered
in
pieces
shining
like
stars
screaming
lighting
venus
then
disappear
wait
every
seconds
torture
heroin
drip
no
more
finding
way
let
go
baby
no
escape
modern
fairytale
happy
endings
wind
our
sails
imagine
life
without
breathless
moments
breaking
down
down
baby
