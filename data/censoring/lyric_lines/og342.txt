i
hope
the
ring
you
gave
to
her
turns
finger
green
when
youre
in
bed
with
her
think
of
me
would
never
wish
bad
things
but
dont
well
could
tell
by
flames
that
burned
your
words
read
letter
cause
knew
what
youd
say
give
sunday
school
answer
try
and
make
it
all
ok
does
hurt
know
ill
be
there
bet
sucks
see
my
face
everywhere
was
you
who
chose
end
like
did
last
exactly
do
say
simply
lost
way
she
may
believe
will
again
if
really
knows
truth
deserves
a
trophy
wife
oh
how
cute
ignorance
is
bliss
day
comes
hes
through
hell
youll
die
together
alone
wrote
couldnt
right
repent
yourself
away
they
hear
miss
fall
kiss
want
love
will
