staring
at
a
maple
leaf
leaning
on
the
mother
tree
i
said
to
myself
"we
all
lost
touch"
your
favorite
fruit
is
chocolate
covered
cherries
and
seedless
watermelon
oh
nothing
from
ground
good
enough
body
rise
look
whats
over
me
oh
chariot
golden
waves
are
walking
down
upon
this
face
im
singing
out
loud
guide
give
strength
remember
seeking
moons
rebirth
rains
made
mirrors
of
earth
sun
was
just
yellow
energy
it
living
promise
land
even
fields
sand
seasons
fill
my
mind
cover
bringing
back
more
than
memory
youll
be
vacation
away
place
you
know
what
want
holding
that
cup
its
pouring
sides
make
wanna
spread
arms
fly
chariot
give
me
strength
