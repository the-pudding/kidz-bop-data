take
away
your
things
and
go
you
cant
back
what
said
i
know
ive
heard
it
all
before
at
least
a
million
times
im
not
one
to
forget
dont
believe
believe
left
in
peace
me
pieces
too
hard
breathe
on
my
knees
right
now
ow
so
sick
of
that
same
old
love
tears
up
hearts
had
enough
oh
that
love
spending
any
time
wasting
tonight
know
try
change
mind
cause
wont
be
changing
too
feels
like
torn
apart
the
kind
breaks
heart
that
love
