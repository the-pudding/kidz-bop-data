i
used
to
be
so
happy
but
without
you
here
feel
low
watched
as
left
can
never
seem
let
go
cause
once
upon
a
time
were
my
everything
its
clear
see
that
hasnt
changed
thing
buried
deep
inside
me
theres
somethin
should
know
will
forget
always
by
side
from
the
day
met
knew
would
love
til
die
and
want
much
more
in
heart
sure
funny
how
we
both
end
up
here
seems
right
wonder
what
happen
if
went
back
put
fight
so
this
world
do
think
could
ever
take
off
mind
take
mind
be
side
day
you
sure
never
feelin
it
lovin
all
along
had
special
with
sometimes
just
gotta
these
things
fall
through
im
still
tied
cant
hide
connection
something
