look
at
what
youve
done
stand
still
fallin
away
from
me
when
it
takes
so
long
fires
out
do
you
want
to
be
now
im
holdin
on
myself
was
never
enough
for
gotta
be
strong
theres
a
power
in
now
every
other
day
ill
watching
show
feels
like
the
outside
we
did
everything
right
give
no
reason
stay
close
tell
lovers
how
are
still
breathing
its
us
choose
strength
