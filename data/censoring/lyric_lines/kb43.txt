where
is
the
moment
when
we
need
it
most
you
kick
up
leaves
and
magic
lost
they
tell
me
your
blue
skys
faded
to
grey
passions
gone
away
i
dont
no
carrying
on
stand
in
line
just
hit
a
new
low
youre
faking
smile
with
coffee
go
lifes
been
way
off
falling
pieces
everytime
chorus:
cause
had
bad
day
taking
one
down
sing
sad
song
turn
around
say
know
lie
work
at
for
ride
camera
coming
back
really
mind
well
sky
holiday
point
laugh
what
sometimes
system
goes
blink
whole
thing
turns
out
wrong
might
not
make
that
could
be
oh
strong
im
so
passion
seem
like
how
does
feel
more
time
