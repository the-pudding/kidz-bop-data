like
a
small
boat
on
the
ocean
sending
big
waves
into
motion
how
single
word
can
make
a heart open
i
might
only have
one
chance
but
make an
explosion
and
all
those
things
didnt
say
wrecking
balls
inside
my
brain
will
scream
them
loud
tonight
you
hear
voice
this
time
is
fight
song
take
back
life
prove
im
alright
hey
powers
turned
starting
right
now
ill
be
strong
play
dont
really
care
if
nobody
else
believes
cause
ive
still
got
lot
of
left
in
me
losing
friends
chasing
sleep
everybodys
worried
about

years
