im
still
alive
but
barely
breathing
just
praying
to
a
thing
that
i
dont
believe
in
cause
got
time
while
she
freedom
when
heart
breaks
no
it
breakeven
her
best
days
will
be
some
of
my
worst
finally
met
boy
thats
gonna
put
first
wide
awake
shes
trouble
sleeping
even
what
am
supposed
do
the
part
me
was
always
you
and
say
all
choked
up
youre
okay
falling
pieces
yeah
they
bad
things
happen
for
reason
wise
words
stop
bleeding
moved
on
grieving
oh
his
none
pain
took
your
suitcase
blame
now
trying
make
sense
little
remains
left
with
love
name
