found
myself
dreaming
in
silver
and
gold
like
a
scene
from
movie
that
every
broken
heart
knows

were
walking
on
moonlight
you
pulled
me
close
split
second
disappeared
then
was
all
alone
woke
up
tears
with
by
my
side
breath
of
relief
realized
no

not
promised
tomorrow
so
im
gonna
love
you
lose
hold
saying
goodbye
wherever
standing
wont
take
for
granted
cause
well
never
know
when
run
out
time
lose
you
the
blink
an
eye
just
whisper
smoke
could
everything
truth
is
ill
kiss
longer
babe
hey
any
chance
get
make
most
minutes
no
regret
lets
our
to
say
what
want

use
got
before
