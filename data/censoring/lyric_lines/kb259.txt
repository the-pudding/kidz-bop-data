songs
songs‚
just
wanna
go
home‚
home
woah

party
trying
my
best
to
meet
somebody
but
everybody
around
me
is
fallin
in
our
song
i
i‚
oh
yeah
hate
it
talkin
a
lot
cause
i
cant
take
dont
think
that
they
feel
anything
strong
hold
on
strangers
watching
them
all
pass
by
those
and
when
leave
back
hurts
like
heaven
lost
the
sound
buzzcut
season
youre
still
unmiss

now
someone
home
cause
