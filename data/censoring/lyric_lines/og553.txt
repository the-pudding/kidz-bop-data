the
real
me
is
a
southern
girl
with
her
levis
on
and
an
open
heart
wish
i
could
save
world
like
was
super
used
to
laugh
all
night
lying
in
grass
just
talking
about
love
but
lately
ive
been
jaded
life
got
so
complicated
start
thinking
it
almost
forgot
what
know
feels
you
can
let
my
hair
down
say
anything
crazy
youll
catch
right
before
hit
ground
nothing
t-shirt
never
felt
beautiful
baby
as
do
now
that
im
you
oh-oh
oh-oh
speak
its
song
that
walls
come
private
joke
meant
for
us
relate
naturally
everybody
else
fades
away
sometimes
hard
breathe
knowing
found
cause
when
take
nobody
be
myself
baby
now
now
you
crazy
