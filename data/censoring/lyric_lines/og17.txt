lets
make
this
fleeting
moment
last
forever
so
tell
me
what
youre
waiting
for
im
gonna
keep
it
frozen
here
theres
no
regretting
anymore
its
worth
the
wait
even
so
far
away
making
night
mine
until
day
i
die
light
to
brake
when
hanging
by
fate
you
know
feels
like
dancing
blind
all
alone
just
beat
inside
my
soul
take
home
where
dreams
are
made
of
gold
in
zone
is
uncontrolled
come
on
feel
alive
feel
alive
meet
under
shining
lights
ive
been
right
life
feelings
cant
deny
that
living
open
up
your
eyes
and
wanna
sink
into
crazy
laughter
on
pain
dont
matter
every
second
makes
heart
faster
finally
think
found
chasing
after
