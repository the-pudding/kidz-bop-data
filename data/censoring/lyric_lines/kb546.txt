like
a
movie
scene
in
the
sweetest
dreams
i
have
pictured
us
together
now
to
feel
your
lips
on
my
fingertips
say
is
even
better
then
ever
thought
it
could
possibly
be
its
perfect
pa**ion
setting
me
free
from
all
of
sadness
tears
that
ive
cried
spent
life
waiting
for
tonight
oh
when
you
would
here
arms
dreamed
this
love
so
long
tonight
tender
words
take
breath
away
now
leave
never
found
sacred
place
lost
embrace
want
stay
forever
think
days
sun
used
set
empty
heart
alone
bed
tossing
and
turning
emotions
were
strong
knew
had
hold
gone
are
heart
