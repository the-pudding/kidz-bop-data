waking
up
to
kiss
you
and
nobody’s
there
the
smell
of
your
perfume
still
stuck
in
air
it’s
hard
yesterday
i
thought
saw
shadow
running
round
funny
how
things
never
change
this
old
town
so
far
from
stars
want
tell
everything
words
got
say
first
time
around
remember
when
we
were
children
playing
fairground
wish
was
with
now
if
whole
world
watching
i’d
dance
drive
highways
byways
be
over
only
truth
comes
back
that
moved
on
someone
new
pub
met
he’s
his
arms
because
make
me
nervous
walk
room
them
butterflies
they
come
alive
i’m
next
know
wrong
can’t
move
but
there’s
something
about
