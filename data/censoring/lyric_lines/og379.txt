loving
can
hurt
hurt
sometimes
but
its
the
only
thing
that
i
know
when
it
gets
hard
you
get
hard
is
makes
us
feel
alive
we
keep
this
love
in
a
photograph
made
these
memories
for
ourselves
where
our
eyes
are
never
closing
hearts
were
broken
and
times
forever
frozen
still
so
me
inside
pocket
of
your
ripped
jeans
holding
close
until
meet
wont
ever
be
alone
wait
to
come
home
heal
mend
soul
know
swear
will
easier
remember
with
every
piece
ya
take
die
alone
if
me
thats
okay
baby
words
bleed
pages
just
hold
wont
let
go
oh
fit
necklace
got
sixteen
next
heartbeat
should
deep
within
im
away
how
kissed
under
lamppost
back
on
sixth
street
hearing
whisper
through
phone
