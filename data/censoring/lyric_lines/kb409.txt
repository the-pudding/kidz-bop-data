theres
a
fire
starting
in
my
heart
reaching
fever
pitch
and
its
bringing
me
out
the
dark
finally
i
can
see
you
crystal
clear
go
ahead
sell
ill
lay
it
up
there
how
leave
with
every
piece
of
dont
underestimate
things
that
will
do
scars
your
love
remind
us
they
keep
thinking
we
almost
had
all
breathless
cant
help
could
have
rolling
deep
inside
hand
played
to
beat
baby
no
story
be
told
but
heard
one
im
gonna
make
head
burn
think
depths
despair
home
down
cause
mine
sure
wont
shared
beating
throw
soul
through
open
door
count
blessings
find
what
look
for
turn
sorrow
into
treasured
gold
pay
back
kind
reap
just
sow
