i
remember
what
you
wore
on
the
first
day
came
into
my
life
and
thought
hey
know
this
could
be
somethin
cos
everything
do
in
words
say
it
always
takes
breath
away
now
im
left
with
nothin
so
maybe
its
true
that
cant
live
without
two
is
better
than
one
theres
much
time
to
figure
out
rest
of
youve
already
got
me
coming
undone
thinking
every
look
upon
your
face
way
roll
eyes
make
hard
for
breathing
when
close
drift
think
everythings
okay
finally
believing
its
but
figured
all
thats
said
done
