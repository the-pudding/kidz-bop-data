i
miss
the
taste
of
sweet
life
conversation
im
searching
for
a
song
tonight
changing
all
stations
like
to
think
that
we
had
it
drew
map
better
place
but
on
road
took
fall
oh
baby
why
did
you
run
away
was
there
in
your
darkest
times
nights
wonder
where
were
when
at
my
worst
down
knees
and
said
back
so
roads
came
me
following
leads
aint
nothing
can
do
following
hear
voice
sleep
night
hard
resist
feeling
cause
these
strangers
come
over
now
cant
get
no
just
yeah
ah
