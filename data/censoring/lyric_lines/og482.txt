the
story
of
us
how
we
met
and
sparks
flew
instantly
people
would
say
theyre
lucky
ones

place
was
a
spot
next
you

im
searching
room
for
an
empty
seat
cause
lately

even
what
page
youre
on
oh
simple
complication
miscommunications
lead
fallout
so
many
things
that
wish
knew
walls
up
cant
break
through
standing
alone
in
crowded
were
not
speaking
dying

me
yeah
say
since
twist
fate
when
all
broke
down
looks
lot
tragedy
chapter
howd
end
up
this
way
see
me
nervously
pulling
at
clothes
trying
look
busy
doing
your
best

but
held
pride

pretending
nothing
id
miss

never
heard
silence
quite
loud
fate
looking
contest
who
can
act

side
battles
