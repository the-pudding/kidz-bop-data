i
got
this
feeling
on
the
summer
day
when
you
were
gone
drove
your
car
across
bridge
watched
let
it
swim
threw
stuff
into
a
bag
and
pushed
down
stairs
bridge
dont
care
love
it
care
youre
different
road
im
in
milky
way
want
me
earth
but
am
up
space
soso
hard
to
please
we
gotta
flip
switch
from
70s
kidz
bop
