written
in
these
walls
are
the
stories
that
i
cant
explain
leave
my
heart
open
but
it
stays
right
here
empty
for
days
she
told
me
hallway
dont
feel
same
about
us
her
bones
seems
to
when
go
words
will
be
on
own
and
ill
gone
gone
tonight
ground
beneath
feet
is
wide
way
been
holdin
too
tight
with
nothing
between
story
of
life
take
home
im
by
side
keep
warm
time
frozen
the
of
of
give
hope
spend
love
until
broke
inside
colors
change
its
cage
know
morning
see
light
upon
hill
although
am
broken
untamed
still
waiting
this
come
around
baby
running
after
you
like
chasing
clouds
give
hope
