my
life
is
brilliant
brilliant
love
pure
i
saw
an
angel
of
that
im
sure
she
smiled
at
me
on
a
subway
was
with
another
man
but
wont
lose
no
sleep
cause
ive
got
plan
youre
beautiful
beautiful
its
true
your
face
in
crowded
place
and
dont
know
what
to
do
ill
never
be
you
yes
caught
eye
as
we
walked
by
could
see
from
flying
high
think
her
again
shared
moment
will
last
till
the
end
there
must
angel
smile
when
thought
up
should
time
truth
