the
same
mistakes
that
you

let
myself
cause
my
heart
so
much
misery
break

learned
to
never
it
get
far
because
of
ill

on
safe
side
dont
hurt
find
trust
only
me
but
everyone
around
me
am
afraid
lose
and
its
long
before
point
out
cannot
cry
a
moments
weakness
in
your
eyes
im
forced
fake
smile
laugh
every
day
life
cant
possibly
when
wasnt
even
whole
start
with
watched
cry
heard
night
sleep
was
young
should
have
known
better
than
lean
thought
anyone
else
just
saw
pain
now
middle
for
old
thing
stay
side
tried
hardest
forget
everything
know
how
ashamed
empty
