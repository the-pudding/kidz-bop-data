turn
the
lights
on
every
night
i
rush
to
bed
with
hopes
that
maybe
ill
get
a
chance
see
you
when
close
my
eyes
im
going
out
of
head
lost
in
fairytale
can
hold
hands
and
be
guide
clouds
filled
stars
cover
your
skies
hope
it
rains
youre
perfect
lullaby
what
kinda
dream
is
this
sweet
or
beautiful
nightmare
either
way
dont
wanna
wake
up
from
somebody
pinch
me
loves
too
good
true
guilty
pleasure
aint
nowhere
baby
long
as
here
floating
air
cause
mention
say
prayers
wrap
around
all
thoughts
boy
certain
type
guy
wish
go
there
arms
for
real
tell
youll
stay
by
side
ive
got
name
across
heart
so
will
remain
not
even
death
make
us
part
kind
