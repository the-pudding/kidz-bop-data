when
i
was
younger
saw
my
daddy
cry
and
curse
at
the
wind
he
broke
his
own
heart
watched
as
tried
to
reassemble
it
mama
swore
that
she
would
never
let
herself
forget
day
promised
id
sing
of
love
if
does
not
exist
but
darling
you
are
only
exception
maybe
know
somewhere
deep
in
soul
lasts
weve
got
find
other
ways
make
alone
but
keep
a
straight
face
ive
always
lived
like
this
keeping
comfortable
distance
up
until
now
had
sworn
myself
im
content
with
loneliness
because
none
ever
worth
risk
well
tight
grip
on
reality
cant
go
whats
front
me
here
know
youre
leaving
morning
wake
leave
some
kind
proof
its
dream
way
believing
oh
