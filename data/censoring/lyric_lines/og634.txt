listen
to
your
heart
i
know
theres
something
in
the
wake
of
smile
get
a
notion
from
look
eyes
yeah
youve
built
love
but
that
love
falls
apart
little
piece
heaven
turns
too
dark
when
hes
calling
for
you
nothing
else
can
do
dont
where
youre
going
and
why
before
tell
him
goodbye
sometimes
wonder
if
this
fight
is
worthwhile
precious
moments
are
all
lost
tide
theyre
swept
away
what
it
seems
feeling
belonging
dreams
