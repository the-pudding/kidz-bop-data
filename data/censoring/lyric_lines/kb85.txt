how
can
you
see
into
my
eyes
like
open
doors
leading
down
core
where
ive
become
so
numb
without
a
soul
spirit
sleeping
somewhere
cold
until
find
it
there
and
lead
back
home
wake
me
up
up
inside
i
cant
call
name
save
from
the
dark
bid
blood
to
run
before
come
undone
nothing
now
that
know
what
im
just
leave
breathe
make
real
bring
life
been
living
lie
theres
frozen
your
touch
love
darling
only
are
among
dead
all
this
time
believe
couldnt
kept
in
but
were
front
of
thousand
years
seems
got
everything
thought
voice
dont
let
die
here
