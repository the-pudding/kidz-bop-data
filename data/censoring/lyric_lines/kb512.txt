when
your
legs
dont
work
like
they
used
to
before
and
i
cant
sweep
you
off
of
feet
will
mouth
still
remember
the
taste
my
love
eyes
smile
from
cheeks

70
baby
heart
could
fall
as
hard
at

im
thinking
bout
how
people
in
love
mysterious
ways
maybe
just
touch
a
hand
well
me
with
every
single
day
wanna
tell
am
so
honey
now
take
into
arms
kiss
under
light
thousand
stars
place
head
on
beating
out
loud
that
we
found
right
where
are
hairs
all
but
gone
memory
fades
crowds
name
hands
play
strings
same
way
know
cause
soul
never
grow
old
its
evergreen
smiles
forever
mind
part
plan
ill
keep
making
mistakes
hoping
youll
understand
oh
darling
