i
let
it
fall
my
heart
and
as
fell
you
rose
to
claim
was
dark
over
until
hold
hands
saved
me
hands
they
were
strong
but
knees
far
too
weak
stand
in
your
arms
without
falling
feet
theres
a
side
that
never
knew
all
the
things
youd
say
true
true
games
play
would
always
win
win
set
fire
rain
watched
pour
i
touched
face
well
burn
while
cried
cause
heard
screaming
out
name
name
when
sit
with
could
stay
there
close
eyes
feel
here
forever
together
nothing
is
better
threw
us
into
flames
felt
something
died
knew
last
time
time
sometimes
id
wake
up
by
door
hurt
must
be
waiting
for
ya
even
now
were
already
cant
help
myself
from
looking
oh
oh
ooh
