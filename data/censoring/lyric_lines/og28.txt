since
you
went
away
left
without
a
word
and
nothing
to
say

when
i
was
the
one
who
gave
my
heart
soul
but
it
wasnt
good
enough
for
you

so
asked
god
send
me
an
angel
from
heavens
above
heal
broken
being
in
love
cause
all
do
is
cry
is
cry
wipe
tears
eyes
know
might
sound
crazy
after
that
still
wanna
come
back
life
now
theres
something
have
tell
that
once
adored

cant
more
take
lies
are
out
of
cries
so
all

on
knees
begging
please

feel
like

your
touch

love
took
granted
