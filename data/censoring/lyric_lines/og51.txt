seems
like
just
yesterday
you
were
a
part
of
me
i
used
to
stand
so
tall
be
strong
your
arms
around
tight
everything
it
felt
right
unbreakable
nothing
could
go
wrong
now
cant
breathe
no
sleep
im
barely
hangin
on
here
am
once
again
torn
into
pieces
deny
it
pretend
thought
the
one
broken
up
deep
inside
but
wont
get
see
tears
cry
behind
these
hazel
eyes
told
everything
opened
up
and
let
in
made
feel
alright
for
my
life
all
thats
left
is
what
together
cause
swallow
then
spit
out
hating
you
blame
myself
seeing
kills
dont
outside
anymore
