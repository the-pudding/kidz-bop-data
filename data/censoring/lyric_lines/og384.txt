well
you
almost
had
me
fooled
told
that
i
was
nothing
without
oh
but
after
everything
youve
done
can
thank
for
how
strong
have
become
’cause
brought
the
flames
and
put
through
hell
to
learn
fight
myself
we
both
know
all
truth
could
tell
ill
just
say
this
is
wish
farewell
hope
youre
somewhere
prayin’
prayin
your
soul
changin
changin
find
peace
falling
on
knees
im
proud
of
who
am
no
more
monsters
breathe
again
said
were
wrong
now
best
yet
come
cause
make
it
my
own
oh
dont
need
you
found
a
strength
i’ve
never
known
i’ll
bring
thunder
rain
oh-oh
when
i’m
finished
they
wont
even
name
sometimes
pray
at
night
someday
maybe
youll
see
light
some
say
in
life
gonna
get
what
give
things
only
god
forgive
prayin
