help
me
its
like
the
walls
are
caving
in
sometimes
i
feel
giving
up
but
just
cant
it
isnt
my
blood
laying
on
bathroom
floor
feeling
nothing
im
overwhelmed
and
insecure
give
me
something
could
take
to
ease
mind
slowly
have
a
drink
youll
better
her
home
keep
telling
that
gets
does
ever
no
medicine
is
strong
enough
someone
crawling
skin
looking
through
phone
again
anxious
afraid
be
alone
again
hate
this
trying
find
way
chill
breathe
oh
there
somebody
who
could
need
now
out
blood
