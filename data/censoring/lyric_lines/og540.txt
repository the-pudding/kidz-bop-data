lucky
you
were
born
that
far
away
so
we
could
both
make
fun
of
distance
i
love
a
foreign
land
for
the
fact
your
existence
baby
would
climb
andes
solely
to
count
freckles
on
body
never
imagine
there
only
ten
million
ways
somebody
le
ro
lo
le
cant
see
im
at
feet
whenever
wherever
were
meant
be
together
ill
and
youll
near
thats
deal
my
dear
thereover
hereunder
have
wonder
can
always
play
by
ear
but
lips
not
mumble
they
spill
kisses
like
fountain
breasts
are
small
humble
dont
confuse
them
with
mountains
strong
legs
mother
run
cover
when
need
it
these
two
eyes
no
other
day
leave
will
cry
river
think
out
loud
say
again
tell
me
one
more
time
live
lost
in
youve
got
head
over
heels
theres
nothing
left
fear
if
really
feel
way
