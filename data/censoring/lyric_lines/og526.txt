my
face
above
the
water
feet
cant
touch
ground
ground
and
it
feels
like
i
can
see
sands
on
horizon
everytime
you
are
not
around
im
slowly
drifting
away
drifting
away
wave
after
wave
drowning
pulling
against
stream
wish
could
make
easy
to
love
me
me
but
still
reach
find
a
way
stuck
here
in
between
looking
for
right
words
say
drifting
