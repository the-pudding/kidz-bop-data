never
you
lift
my
heart
up
when
the
rest
of
me
is
down
you
enchant
even
youre
not
around
if
there
are
boundaries
i
will
try
to
knock
them
iâ€™m
latching
on
babe
now
know
what
have
found
feel
were
close
enough
wanna
lock
in
your
love
think
could
love
baby
ive
got
space
wont
let
go
shackled
embrace
im
on
so
encaptured
wrapped
touch
enamoured
hold
tight
within
clutch
how
do
it
losing
every
breath
did
give
make
beat
out
chest
go
