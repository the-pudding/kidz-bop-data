the
dark
lit

up
made
feel
as

danced
night
away
drank
too
much
held
your
hair
back
when
were
throwing

smiled
over
shoulder
for
a
minute
stone
cold
sober
pulled
closer
to
my
chest
and
asked

get
some
rest

cool
scared
of
letting
go

wanna
with
until
were
grey
old
just
say
wont
let

on
head

wave
them
goodbye

make
this
way
somehow
so

more
than
worth
its
weight
gold
weve
come
far
