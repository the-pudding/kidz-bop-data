we
clawed
chained
our
hearts
in
vain
jumped
never
asking
why
kissed
i
fell
under
your
spell
a
love
no
one
could
deny
dont
you
ever
say
just
walked
away
will
always
want
cant
live
lie
running
for
my
life
came
like
wrecking
ball
hit
so
hard
all
wanted
was
to
break
walls
did
wreck
me
yeah
you
put
high
up
the
sky
and
now
youre
not
coming
down
it
slowly
turned
let
burn
were
ashes
on
ground
closed
eyes
swung
left
crashing
blazing
fall
meant
start
war
instead
of
using
force
guess
shouldve
win
