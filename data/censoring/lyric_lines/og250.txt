from
underneath
the
trees
we
watch
sky
confusing
stars
for
satellites
i
never
dreamed
that
youd
be
mine
but
here
are
were
tonight
singing
amen
im
alive
im
alive
singing
if
everyone
cared
and
nobody
cried
loved
lied
shared
swallowed
their
pride
then
wed
see
day
when
died
i
in
air
fireflies
our
only
light
paradise
well
show
world
they
were
wrong
teach
them
all
to
sing
along
as
lie
beneath
realize
how
small
are
could
love
like
you
me
imagine
what
day
