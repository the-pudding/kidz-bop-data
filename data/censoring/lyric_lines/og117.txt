think
that
youll
die
without
him
know
thats
a
lie
tell
yourself
fear
lay
alone
forever
now

aint
true

so
put
your
arms
around
me
tonight
let
the
music
lift
up
like
youve
never
been
high
open
heart
to
this
free
til
feel
sunrise
warm
body
heat
of
thousand
fires
crying
in
club
hey
hey
beat
carry
away
tears
as
they
fall
baby
with
little
faith
turn
ecstasy

may
her
but
told
meet
another
pure
true
said

crying
