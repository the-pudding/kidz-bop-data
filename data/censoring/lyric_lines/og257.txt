empty
spaces
fill
me
up
with
holes
distant
faces
no
place
left
to
go
without
you
within
i
cant
find
rest
where
i’m
going
is
anybody’s
guess
tried
on
like
never
knew
awake
but
my
world
half
asleep
pray
for
this
heart
be
unbroken
all
incomplete
voices
tell
should
carry
am
swimming
in
an
ocean
alone
baby
baby
it’s
written
your
face
still
wonder
if
we
made
a
big
mistake
don’t
mean
drag
it
on
can’t
seem
let
want
make
alone
