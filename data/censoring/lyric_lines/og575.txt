took
you
like
a
shot
thought
that
i
could
chase
with
cold
evenin
let
couple
years
water
down
how
i’m
feelin
about
feelin
you
and
every
time
we
talk
single
word
builds
up
to
this
moment
gotta
convince
myself
don’t
want
it
even
though
do
even
do
break
my
heart
in
two
but
when
heals
beats
for
know
its
forward
true
wanna
hold
im
not
supposed
lyin
close
someone
else
youre
stuck
head
cant
get
out
of
if
all
again
i’d
go
back
you
oh
id
never
got
right
playin’
replayin
old
conversations
overthinkin
hate
cause
it’s
me
cause
me
me
whats
the
point
hidin
everybody
knows
unfinished
business
ill
regret
didnt
say
isnt
what
be
isnt

said
wasnt
sure
can
wont
lie
know
thoughts
are
runnin
loose
just
