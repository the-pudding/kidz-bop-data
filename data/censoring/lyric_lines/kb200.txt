started
chasing
after
you
falling
even
more
in
love
with
letting
go
of
all

held
on
standing
here
until
make
me
move
hanging
by
a
moment
forgetting
lacking
completely
incomplete
ill
take
your
invitation
and
now
living
the
only
thing
know
running
not
quite
sure
dont
what
driving
into
just
theres
nothing
else

that
can
change
my
mind
