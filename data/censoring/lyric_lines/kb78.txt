you
can
be
amazing
turn
a
phrase
into
putdown
or
hug
the
outcast
backlash
of
somebodys
lack
love
start
speaking
up
nothings
gonna
hurt
way
that
words
do
when
they
settle
â€˜neath
your
skin
kept
on
inside
and
no
sunlight
sometimes
shadow
wins
but
i
wonder
what
would
happen
if
say
wanna
let
fall
out
honestly
see
brave
with
want
to
just
everybodys
been
there
stared
down
by
enemy
fallen
for
fear
done
some
disappearing
bow
mighty
dont
run
stop
holding
tongue
maybe
theres
this
cage
where
live
one
these
days
light
in
show
me
how
big
is
since
history
silence
wont
any
good
did
think
it
would
anything
empty
why
dont
tell
them
truth
yeah
oh
yeah
yeah
ooh
ooh
