somebody
once
told
me
the
world
is
gonna
roll
i
aint
sharpest
tool
in
shed
she
was
looking
kinda
dumb
with
her
finger
and
thumb
shape
of
an
"l"
on
forehead
well
years
start
coming
they
dont
stop
fed
to
rules
hit
ground
running
didnt
make
sense
not
live
for
fun
your
brain
gets
smart
but
head
so
much
do
see
whats
wrong
takin
backstreets
youll
never
know
if
you
go
shine
glow
hey
now
youre
all
star
get
game
on
play
a
rock
show
paid
and
that
glitters
gold
only
shooting
stars
break
mold
its
cool
place
say
it
colder
bundled
up
wait
til
older
media
men
beg
differ
judging
by
hole
satellite
picture
ice
we
skate
getting
pretty
thin
waters
warm
might
as
swim
my
worlds
fire
how
about
yours
thats
way
like
bored
asked
"could
spare
some
change
gas
need
myself
away
from
this
place"
said
yep
what
concept
could
use
little
fuel
taking
back
streets
