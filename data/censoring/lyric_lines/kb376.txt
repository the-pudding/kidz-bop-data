sick
and
tired
of
this
world
theres
no
more
air
trippin
over
myself
goin
nowhere
waiting
suffocating
direction
i
took
a
dive
on
the
way
down
saw
you
saved
me
from
myself
wont
forget
loved
almost
fell
right
through
but
held
onto
ive
been
wondering
why
its
only
have
always
inside
waiting
to
breathe
alright
sunlight
my
face
wake
up
yeah
im
alive
cause
down
now
was
so
afraid
going
under
weight
world
feels
like
nothing
no
nothing
youre
all
wanted
needed
that
wanted
oh
through
yeah
