remember
when
we
broke
up
the
first
time
saying
"this
is
it
ive
had
enough"
cause
like
hadnt
seen
each
other
in
a
month
you
said
needed
"space"
what
then
come
around
again
and
say
"baby

im
gonna
change

me"
how
that
lasted
for
day
say
"i
hate
you"
break
up

it
off
last
night
but
this
time
telling

never

getting
back
together
go
talk
to
your
friends

me
like
really
picking
fights
falling
screaming
right
would
hide
away
find
peace
of
mind
with
some
indie
record
thats
much
cooler
than
mine
