your
subtleties
they
bother
me
i
cant
explain
myself
at
all
and
the
wants
needs
dont
want
to
need
walls
start
breathing
my
minds
unweaving
maybe
its
best
you
leave
alone
a
weight
is
lifted
on
this
evening
give
final
blow
when
darkness
turns
light
it
ends
tonight
tonight
falling
star
least
fall
what
youre
finding
things
that
didnt
know
look
with
so
much
pain
just
little
insight
wont
make
right
too
late
fight
now
im
own
side
better
than
being
fault
blind
see
through
eyes
these
thoughts
locked
inside
