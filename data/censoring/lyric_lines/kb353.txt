some
things
we
dont
talk
about
rather
do
without
just
hold
a
smile
falling
in
and
out
of
love
ashamed
proud
together
all
the
while
you
can
never
say
know
when
time
again
younger
now
than
were
before
let
me
go
picture
youre
queen
everything
as
far
eye
see
under
your
command
i
will
be
guardian
is
crumbling
steady
hand
time
were
pulling
apart
coming
growing
but
well
pull
it
together
