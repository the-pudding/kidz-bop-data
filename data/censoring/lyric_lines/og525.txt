i
dont
want
to
see
you
waiting
ive
already
gone
too
far
away
still
cant
keep
the
day
from
ending
no
more
messed
up
reasons
for
me
stay
well
this
is
not
real
afraid
feel
just
hit
floor
ask
im
wasting
my
time
wasted
stop
feeling
there
reason
make
call
and
take
it
all
again
whoa-oh
months
went
by
with
us
pretending
when
did
our
light
turn
green
red
took
a
chance
left
standing
lost
will
do
once
look
so
lonely
