when
we
broke
up
the
first
time
saying

is
it
ive
had
enough
cause
like
havent
seen
each
other
in
a
month

said
needed
space
what
then
you
come
around
again
and
say

miss
swear
im
gonna
change
trust
me
how
that
lasted
for
day

up
call
love
oooh

it
off
last
night
but
oooh
telling

never
ever
getting
back
together
go
talk
to
your
friends

me
ever
really
picking
fights
falling
screaming
right
will
hide
away
find
piece
of
mind
with
some
indie
record
thats
much
cooler
than
