so
lately
ive
been
wonderin
who
will
be
there
to
take
my
place
when
im
gone
youll
need
love
light
the
shadows
on
your
face
if
a
great
wave
shall
fall
it
would
upon
us
all
and
between
sand
stone
could
you
make
own
i
could
then
ill
go
wherever
way
up
high
or
down
low
maybe
find
out
back
someday
watch
you
guide
through
darkest
of
days
hope
theres
someone
can
bring
me
runaway
with
heart
know
now
just
quite
how
life
might
still
in
mind
stay
for
time
turn
mine
