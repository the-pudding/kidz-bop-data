shes
cold
and
cruel
but
she
knows
what
doing
pushed
me
in
the
pool
at
our
last
school
reunion
laughs
my
dreams
i
dream
about
her
laughter
strange
as
it
seems
one
im
after
cause
bittersweet
knocks
off
of
feet
cant
help
myself
dont
want
anyone
else
a
mystery
too
much
for
keep
coming
back
more
just
girl
looking
secret
than
an
hour
runs
on
100
proof
attitude
power
ignores
adore
can
do
id
do
anything
when
sees
its
caller
id
wont
pick
up
phone
shed
rather
be
alone
give
yet
every
word
ever
said
is
still
ringing
head
to
say
so
whole
day
ruined
oh
