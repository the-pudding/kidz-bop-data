the
darkness
guided
by
a
beating
heart
i
cant
tell
where
journey
will
end
but
know
to
start

im
too
young
understand
say
caught
up
in
dream
well
life
pass
if
dont
open
eyes
thats
fine
so
wake
when
its
all
over
wiser
and
older
this
time
was
finding
myself
didnt
know﻿
lost
﻿i
tried
carrying
weight
of
world
only
have
two
hands
hope
get
chance
travel
any
plans
wish
that
could
stay
forever
not
afraid
close
lifes
game﻿

for
everyone
