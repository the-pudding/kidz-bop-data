i
probably
shouldnt
say
this
but
at
times
get
so
scared
when
think
about
the
previous
relationship
we
shared
it
was
awesome
lost
its
not
possible
for
me
to
care
you
know
care
and
now
were
standing
in
rain
nothings
ever
gonna
change
until
youre
here
my
dear
7
things
hate
vain
your
games
insecure
love
me
like
her
make
laugh
cry
dont
which
side
buy
friends
theyre
jerks
act
them
just
hurts
wanna
be
with
one
7th
thing
most
that
do
awkward
silent
as
wait
what
need
hear
sincere
apology
mean
it
ill
believe
if
text
delete
lets
clear
oh
im
coming
back
taking
steps
compared
all
great
would
take
too
long
write
should
mention
hair
eyes
old
levis
kiss
hypnotized
guess
thats
both
have
hands
mine
intertwined
everythings
alright
