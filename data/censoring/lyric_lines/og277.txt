kiss
me
out
of
the
bearded
barley
nightly
beside
green
green
grass
swing
swing
spinning
step
you
wear
those
shoes
and
i
will
that
dress
oh
beneath
milky
twilight
lead
me
on
moonlit
floor
lift
your
open
hand
strike
up
band
make
fireflies
dance
silver
moons
sparkling
so
down
by
broken
tree
house
upon
its
hanging
tire
bring
bring
flowered
hat
well
take
trail
marked
fathers
map
