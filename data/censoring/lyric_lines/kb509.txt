to
think
one
day

tell
the
story
of
us
how
we
met
and
sparks
flew
instantly
people
would
say
theyre
lucky
ones
know
my
place
was
a
spot
next
you
now
im
searching
room
for
an
empty
seat
cause
lately
dont
even
what
page
youre
on
oh
simple
complication
miscommunications
lead
fallout
too
many
things
that
wish
knew
so
walls
cant
break
through
standing
alone
in
crowded
were
not
speaking
dying

it
killing
like
its
me
yeah
say
twist
fate
when
all
broke
down
looks
lot
tragedy
chapter
howd
end
up
this
way
see
me
nervously
pulling
at
clothes
trying
look
busy
doing
your
best
avoid
started
id
losing
mind
saw
here
but
held
pride
shouldve
oh
scared
ending
why
are
pretending
nothing
miss
ive
never
heard
silence
quite
loud
looking
contest
who
can
act
careless
liked
better
were
side
battles
hands
lay
armor
if
youd
rather
love
than
fight
wished
might
be
soon
