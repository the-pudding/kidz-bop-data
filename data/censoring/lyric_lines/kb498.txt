paper
bags
and
plastic
hearts
all
our
belongings
in
shopping
carts
goodbye
we
got
one
more
night
lets
have
fun
ride
around
make
peace
with
an
empty
town
can
it
right
throw
away
forget
yesterday
well
the
great
escape
wont
hear
a
word
they
say
dont
know
us
anyway
watch
turn
let
fly
cause
are
finally
free
tonight
will
change
lives
its
so
good
to
be
by
your
side
but
cry
give
up
fight
scream
loud
at
top
of
lungs
theyll
think
just
were
young
feel
alive
wasted
time
hours
that
were
left
behind
answers
never
find
mean
thing
