im
going
under
and
this
time
i
fear
theres
no
one
to
save
me
all
or
nothing
really
got
a
way
of
driving
crazy
need
somebody
heal
know
have
hold
its
easy
say
but
never
the
same
guess
kinda
liked
you
numbed
pain
now
day
bleeds
into
nightfall
youre
not
here
get
through
it
let
my
guard
down
then
pulled
rug
was
getting
used
being
someone
loved
turn
loving
sleeping
without
know
heal
just
how
feels
like
help
escape
tend
close
eyes
when
hurts
sometimes
fall
your
arms
ill
be
safe
in
sound
till
come
back
around
for
now
