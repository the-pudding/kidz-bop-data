now
it
seems
to
me
that
you
know
just
what
say
words
are
only
can
show
something
else
swear
youll
always
be
this
way
how
feel
more
than
ever
baby
i
dont
wanna
lonely
no
have
pay
for
want
the
lover
at
my
door
another
heartache
on
list
angry
youre
one
who
could
never
stand
so
when
tell
love
sure
anymore
its
hard
with
heart
still
mend
open
up
like
do
your
girlfriends
and
sing
its
harmony
girl
is
everything
make
anything;
get
back
again
why
we
try
if
was
good
you
were
hold
till
move
inside
of
paradise
symphonies
gave
all
life
find
some
beside
