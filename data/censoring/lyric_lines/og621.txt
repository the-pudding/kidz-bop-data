you
and
me
we
made
a
vow
for
better
or
worse
i
cant
believe
let
me
down
but
the
proofs
in
way
it
hurts
months
on
end
ive
had
my
doubts
denying
every
tear
wish
this
would
be
over
now
know
that
still
need
here
say
im
crazy
cause
dont
think
what
youve
done
when
call
baby
not
only
one
been
so
unavailable
now
sadly
why
your
heart
is
unobtainable
even
though
lord
knows
kept
mine
have
loved
many
years
maybe
am
just
enough
realise
deepest
fear
by
lying
tearing
us
up
know
