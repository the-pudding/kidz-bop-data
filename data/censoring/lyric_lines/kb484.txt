need
everything
that
we

keeps
wishing
star
song
car

singing

tell
breathe
there
goes
perfectly
kind
of
flawless
wish
could
shed
better
hold
him
tight
give
her
love
look
those
beautiful
eyes
lucky
do
drive
home
alone
as
turn
out
light
put
his
picture
down
maybe
get
some
sleep
tonight
one
whos
enough
break
heart
time
taken
up
theres
never
need
fall
into
