the
snow
glows
white
on
mountain
tonight
not
a
footprint
to
be
seen
kingdom
of
isolation
and
it
looks
like
im
queen
wind
is
howling
this
swirling
storm
inside
couldnt
keep
in
heaven
knows
i
tried!
dont
let
them
see
good
girl
you
always
have
conceal
feel
know
well
now
they
know!
go
go
cant
hold
back
anymore
turn
away
slam
door!
care
what
theyre
going
say
rage
cold
never
bothered
me
anyway!
its
funny
how
some
distance
makes
everything
seem
small
fears
that
once
controlled
get
at
all!
time
can
do
test
limits
break
through
no
right
wrong
rules
for
free!
am
one
with
sky
youll
cry!
here
stand
ill
stay
on!
my
power
flurries
air
into
ground
soul
spiraling
in
frozen
fractals
all
around
thought
crystallizes
an
icy
blast
past
past!
rise
dawn
perfect
gone!
light
day
