were
both
looking
for
something
weve
been
afraid
to
find
its
easier
be
broken
hide
at
you
holding
my
breath
once
in
life
im
scared
death
taking
a
chance
letting
you
inside
feeling
alive
all
over
again
as
deep
the
sky
under
skin
like
being
love
she
says
first
time
maybe
wrong
but
right
where
i
belong
with
tonight
love
feel
world
that
see
waiting
come
waking
me
up
dreaming
reality
your
eyes
crashing
into
unknown
lost
this
it
feels
home
