since
the
moment
i
spotted
you
like
walking
round
with
little
wings
on
my
shoes
stomachs
filled
butterflies
ooh
and
its
alright
bouncing
from
cloud
to
got
feeling
im
never
gonna
come
down
if
said
didnt
it
then
know
id
lied
ooh
but
every
time
try
talk
get
tonguetied
turns
out
everything
say
comes
wrong
right
so
ill
say
"why
dont
together
take
world
be
forever
heads
we
will
tails
well
again"
hold
each
other
fly
moon
straight
heaven
cause
without
you
theyre
let
me
in"
whens
this
fever
break
think
ive
handled
more
than
any
man
can
a
lovesick
puppy
chasing
around
slowly
begin
realize
is
end
about
same
walk
by
"oh
here
go
again
oh"
