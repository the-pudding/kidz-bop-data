i
was
walking
down
the
street
other
day
tryna
distract
myself
but
then
see
your
face
oh
wait
thats
someone
else
play
it
coy
make
disappear
just
like
battle
of
troy
theres
nothing
subtle
here
in
my
room
a
king
size
space
bigger
than
used
to
be
if
you
want
can
rent
that
place
call
me
an
amenity
even
its
dreams
ooh
youre
taking
up
fraction
mind
ooooh
every
time
watch
serpentine
im
tryin
tryin
not
think
about
no
no
give
with
feelings
on
fire
guess
bad
liar
how
attention
builds
looking
mirror
touch
happy
pill
still
all
we
do
is
fear
what
could
possibly
happen
next
focus
love
paint
kiss
across
chest
art
ill
brush
and
baby
lets
reality
actuality
reality
oh
