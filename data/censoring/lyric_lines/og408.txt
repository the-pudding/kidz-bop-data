just
wants
to
be
beautiful

unnoticed
knows
no
limits
craves
attention
praises
an
image
prays
sculpted
by
the
sculptor
oh

see
light
thats
shining
deeper
than

can
find
it
maybe
we
have
made
her
blind
so
tries
cover
up
pain
and
cut
woes
away
cause
covergirls
cry
after
their
face
is
but
theres
a
hope
waiting
for
you
in
dark
should
know
youre
way
are
change

world
could
its
heart
scars
your
beautiful
were
stars

dreams
envy
shes
starving
know
eat
nothing
says
"beauty

everything"
"whats
little
bit
of
hunger"
"i

fades
perfect

worth
or
that
surface
