making
my
way
downtown
walking
fast
faces
pass
and
im
home
bound
staring
blankly
ahead
just
a
through
the
crowd
i
need
you
miss
now
wonder
if
could
fall
into
sky
do
think
time
would
me
by
cause
know
id
walk
thousand
miles
see
tonight
its
always
times
like
these
when
of
ever
every
things
so
wrong
dont
belong
living
in
your
precious
memory
by
i
wanna
let
drown
this
go
still
us
hold
