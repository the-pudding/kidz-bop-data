i
walk
a
lonely
road
the
only
one
that
have
ever
known
dont
know
where
it
goes
but
its
home
to
me
and
alone
this
empty
street
on
boulevard
of
broken
dreams
city
sleeps
im
one
alone
a
my
shadows
walks
beside
me
shallow
hearts
thing
thats
beating
sometimes
wish
someone
out
there
will
find
til
then
walking
down
line
divides
somewhere
in
mind
borderline
edge
read
between
lines
whats
fucked
up
everythings
all
right
check
vital
signs
still
alive
