im
wide
awake
yeah
i
was
in
the
dark
falling
hard
with
an
open
heart
how
did
read
stars
so
wrong
and
now
its
clear
to
me
that
everything
you
see
aint
always
what
it
seems
dreaming
for
long
wish
knew
then
know
wouldnt
dive
bow
down
gravity
hurts
made
sweet
till
woke
up
on
concrete
from
cloud
9
crashing
high
letting
go
tonight
yeah
not
losing
any
sleep
picked
every
piece
landed
my
feet
need
nothing
complete
myself
nooohooo
am
born
again
outta
lions
den
dont
have
pretend
too
late
storys
over
now
end
yeah
go
thunder
rumbling
castles
crumbling
trying
hold
god
knows
tried
seeing
bright
side
but
blind
anymore
