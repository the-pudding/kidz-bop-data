i
like
that
youre
broken
me
maybe
makes
a
fool
lonely
could
be
with
you
met
late
night
at
party
some
trust
fund
babys
brooklyn
loft
by
the
bathroom
said
lets
talk
but
my
confidence
is
wearing
off
these
arent
people
friends
she
grabbed
face
and
thats
when
theres
something
tragic
almost
pure
think
love
you
im
not
sure
wholesome
sweet
tucked
in
your
eyes
id
to
meet
life
song
we
were
all
pieces
floating
can
try
fix
our
one
time
