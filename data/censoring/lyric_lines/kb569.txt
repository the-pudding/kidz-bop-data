watch
my
life
pass
me
by
in
the
rear
view
mirror
pictures
frozen
time
are
becoming
clearer
i
dont
wanna
waste
another
day
stuck
shadow
of
mistakes
yeah
cause
want
you
and
feel
crawling
underneath
skin
like
a
hunger
burning
to
find
place
ive
never
been
now
im
broken
fading
half
man
thought
would
be
but
can
have
whats
left
dying
inside
little
no
where
go
going
out
mind
an
endless
circles
running
from
myself
until
gave
reason
for
standing
still
falling
faster
barely
breathing
give
something
believe
tell
its
not
all
head
take
this
make
whole
once
again
thats
yeah
