and
it’s
over
i’m
circling
these
vultures
just
got
me
praying
that
its
longer
feeling
something
rotten
last
time
i
saw
you
said
“what’s
up”
pushed
right
through
then
tried
to
catch
but
we’re
always
on
the
move
now
older
symptoms
of
culture
night
ain’t
getting
younger
next
day’s
around
corner
kinda
tempted
pouring
out
truth
fading
talkers
‘cause
all
want
is
you
im
sayin’
come
over
here
sit
we
can
see
where
things
go
naturally
say
word
i’ll
part
sea
take
high
well
frontin
my
intention
your
man
outlined
in
chalk
a
midnight
intervention
no
plans
make
it
stop
wanna
keep
light
here
tell
not
trying
change
mind
alright
ooh
ooh
yeah
alright
so
