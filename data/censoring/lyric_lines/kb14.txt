everyday
is
a
new
day
im
thankful
for
every
breath
i
take
wont
it
granted
so
learn
from
my
mistakes
its
beyond
control
sometimes
best
to
let
go
whatever
happens
in
this
lifetime
trust
love
you
have
given
me
peace
of
mind
i
feel
alive
the
very
first
time
cant
deny
an
think
can
fly
sunshine
upon
face
song
sing
tell
world
how
inside
even
though
might
cost
everything
now
that
know
beyond
hold
never
turn
back
away
see
look
could
believe
no
matter
what
they
say
