theres
a
place
off
ocean
avenue
where
i
used
to
sit
and
talk
with
you
we
were
both
16
it
felt
so
right
sleeping
all
day
staying
up
night
on
the
corner
of
cherry
street
would
walk
beach
in
our
bare
feet
18
if
could
find
now
things
get
better
leave
this
town
run
forever
let
your
waves
crash
down
me
take
away
piece
thats
here
its
everywhere
go
everything
see
when
sleep
dream
gets
by
can
make
believe
that
youre
tonight
know
somewhere
somehow
well
be
together
remember
look
eyes
told
was
goodbye
begging
not
here
looking
at
same
sky
keep
pretending
sun
will
rise
for
one
more
