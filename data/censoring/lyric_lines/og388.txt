three
little
birds
sat
on
my
window
and
they
told
me
i
dont
need
to
worry
summer
came
like
cinnamon
so
sweet
girls
doubledutch
the
concrete
maybe
sometimes
weve
got
it
wrong
but
its
alright
more
things
seem
change
stay
same
oh
you
hesitate
girl
put
your
records
on
tell
favorite
song
go
ahead
let
hair
down
sapphire
faded
jeans
hope
get
dreams
just
youre
gonna
find
yourself
somewhere
somehow
blue
as
sky
sunburnt
lonely
sipping
tea
in
a
bar
by
roadside
just
relax
relax
those
other
boys
fool
love
that
afro
hairdo
we
feel
afraid
same
change
think
strange
twas
than
could
take
pity
for
pitys
sake
some
nights
kept
awake
thought
was
stronger
when
realize
even
have
try
any
longer
do
what
want
