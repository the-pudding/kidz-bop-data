do
you
recall
not
long
ago
we
would
walk
on
the
sidewalk
innocent
remember
all
did
was
care
for
each
other
but
night
warm
were
bold
and
young
around
wind
blows
only
hold
to
let
go
blow
a
kiss
fire
gun
need
someone
lean
is
somebody
what
will
when
get
old
down
same
road
be
there
by
my
side
standing
strong
as
waves
roll
over
nights
are
longing
come
home
we
on
on
on
hey
hey
