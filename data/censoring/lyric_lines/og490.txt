i
was
so
high
did
not
recognize
the
fire
burning
in
her
eyes
chaos
that
controlled
my
mind
whispered
goodbye
as
she
got
on
a
plane
never
to
return
again
but
always
heart
this
love
has
taken
its
toll
me
said
too
many
times
before
and
is
breaking
front
of
have
no
choice
cause
wont
say
anymore
tried
best
feed
appetite
keep
coming
every
night
hard
satisfied
playing
like
it
just
game
pretending
feel
same
then
turn
around
leave
ill
fix
these
broken
things
repair
your
wings
make
sure
everythings
alright
its
alright
its
alright
pressure
hips
sinking
fingertips
into
inch
you
know
thats
what
want
do
