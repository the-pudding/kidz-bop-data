i
never
knew
that
everything
was
falling
through
everyone
waiting
on
a
queue
to
turn
and
run
when
all
needed
the
truth
but
thats
how
its
gotta
be
coming
down
nothing
more
than
apathy
id
rather
other
way
stay
see
smoke
whos
still
standing
it
clears
knows
im
in
over
my
head
with
eight
seconds
left
overtime
shes
your
mind
mind
lets
rearrange
wish
you
were
stranger
could
disengage
just
say
we
agree
then
change
soften
bit
until
get
along
disregard
find
another
friend
discard
as
lose
argument
cable
car
hanging
above
canyon
comes
between
on
suddenly
ive
become
part
of
past
becoming
dont
last
losing
effortless
without
sound
sight
ground
throw
around
thought
wanted
bring
wont
let
go
til
torch
