you
lift
my
heart
up
when
the
rest
of
me
is
down
you
enchant
even
youre
not
around
if
there
are
problems
i
will
try
to
knock
them
i’m
latching
on
babe
now
know
what
have
found
feel
were
close
enough
wanna
lock
in
your
love
we’re
could
love
baby
i’ve
got
space
won’t
let
go
shackled
embrace
on
so
encaptured
wrapped
much
enamored
hold
tight
within
clutch
how
do
it
losing
every
breath
why
did
kiss
make
beat
out
chest
