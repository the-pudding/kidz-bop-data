closed
off
from
love
i
didnt
need
the
pain
once
or
twice
was
enough
and
it
all
in
vain
time
starts
to
pass
before
you
know
youre
frozen
but
something
happened
for
very
first
with
my
heart
melted
ground
found
true
everyones
looking
round
thinking
im
going
crazy
dont
care
what
they
say
love
try
pull
me
away
truth
hearts
crippled
by
vein
that
keep
on
closing
cut
open
bleeding
keep
trying
hard
not
hear
talk
so
loud
their
piercing
sounds
fill
ears
doubt
yet
goal
is
falling
nothings
greater
than
risk
comes
your
embrace
this
world
of
loneliness
see
face
everyone
around
thinks
maybe
maybe
its
draining
though
find
believe
ill
be
wearing
these
scars
ooh
i
oohhh
i
keep
ooh
