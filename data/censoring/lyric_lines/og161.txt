you
would
not
believe
your
eyes
if
ten
million
fireflies
lit
up
the
world
as
i
fell
asleep
cause
theyd
fill
open
air
and
leave
teardrops
everywhere
youd
think
me
rude
but
just
stand
stare
id
like
to
make
myself
that
planet
earth
turns
slowly
its
hard
say
rather
stay
awake
when
im
everything
is
never
it
seems
get
a
thousand
hugs
from
lightning
bugs
they
tried
teach
how
dance
foxtrot
above
my
head
sock
hop
beneath
bed
disco
ball
hanging
by
thread
when
fall
asleep
door
crack
please
take
away
here
feel
such
an
insomniac
why
do
tire
of
counting
sheep
far
too
tired
haha
weird
hate
goodbyes
got
misty
said
farewell
said
farewell
ill
know
where
several
are
dreams
real
bizarre
saved
few
keep
them
in
jar
jar
jar
jar
because
bursting
at
seams
