i
had
a
dream
so
big
and
loud
jumped
high
touched
the
clouds
woooooooh
woooooooh
stretched
my
hands
out
to
sky
we
danced
with
monsters
through
night
im
never
gonna
look
back
whoa
give
it
up
no
just
dont
wake
me
now
this
is
be
best
day
of
life
liiiiiiife
howled
at
moon
friends
then
sun
came
crashing
in
but
all
possibilities
limits
epiphanies
hear
calling
outside
window
feel
soul
soul
stars
were
burning
bright
was
til
midnight
say
lose
control
control
woooooooh
be
everything
lookin
up
everybody
now!
