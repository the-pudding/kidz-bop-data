i
used
to
bite
my
tongue
and
hold
breath
scared
rock
the
boat
make
a
mess
so
sat
quietly
agreed
politely
guess
that
forgot
had
choice
let
you
push
me
past
breaking
point
stood
for
nothing
fell
everything
held
down
but
got
up
hey!
already
brushing
off
dust
hear
voice
sound
like
thunder
gonna
shake
ground
get
ready
cause
ive
enough
see
it
all
now
eye
of
tiger
fighter
dancing
through
fire
am
champion
youre
roar
louder
louder
than
lion
oh
im
floating
butterfly
stinging
bee
earned
stripes
went
from
zero
own
hero
roar
rooar
rooar
