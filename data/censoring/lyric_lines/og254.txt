my
best
friend
gave
me
the
advice
he
said
each
days
a
gift
and
not
given
right
leave
no
stone
unturned
your
fears
behind
try
to
take
path
less
traveled
by
that
first
step
you
is
longest
stride
what
if
what
if
if
today
was
last
day
tomorrow
too
late
could
say
goodbye
yesterday
would
live
moment
like
last
old
pictures
in
past
donate
every
dime
have
if
day
against
grain
should
be
way
of
life
whats
worth
prize
always
fight
second
counts
cause
theres
so
youll
never
it
twice
dont
free
ride
own
call
friends
see
reminisce
memories
forgive
enemies
find
one
youre
dreamin
of
swear
up
down
god
above
finally
fall
love
that
love
make
mark
mending
broken
heart
know
its
shoot
for
stars
regardless
who
are
do
whatever
takes
takes
cant
rewind
this
let
nothin
stand
way
hands
time
on
side
