my
happy
ending

over
its
not

it
something
i
did
you
said
dont
leave
me
hanging
in
a
city
held
up
high
on
such
breakable
thread
were
all
the
things
thought
knew
and
we
could
be
everything
everything
that
wanted
meant
to
be
supposed
but
lost
of
our
memories
close
just
fade
away
time
pretending
youve
got
your
dumb
friends
know
what
they
say
tell
im
difficult
are
do
even
you
hide
from
stuff

nice
there

making
feel
only
one
had
watching
as
fall
letting
done
