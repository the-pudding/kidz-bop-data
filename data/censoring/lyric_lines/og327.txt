miss
independent
self-sufficient
keep
your
distance
unafraid
out
of
my
way
dont
let
a
man
interfere
no
on
her
own
almost
grown
never
help
off
throne
so
by
keeping
heart
protected
shed
ever
feel
rejected
little
apprehensive
said
ooh
she
fell
in
love
what
is
this
feelin
takin
over
thinkin
one
could
open
the
door
surprise
its
time
to
whats
real
happened
independent
longer
need
be
defensive
goodbye
old
you
when
true
guarded
play
it
smart
if
wanna
use
that
line
better
not
start
but
miscalculated
didnt
end
up
jaded
and
decided
changing
misconceptions
went
new
direction
found
inside
felt
connection
open
door
goodbye
goodbye
old
you
walked
away
for
came
looked
mirror
thought
today
afraid
took
some
see
how
beautiful
truly
more
talk
"why
cant
me"
im
so
glad
i
finally
taking
surprise
surprise
to
feel
love
