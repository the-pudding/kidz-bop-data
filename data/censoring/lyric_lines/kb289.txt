do
you
recall
not
long
ago
we
would
walk
on
the
sidewalk
innocent
remember
all
did
was care for
each
other
but the
night
was
warm
were
bold and
young
around
wind
blows
only
hold
to
let
go
blow
a
kiss
youre
one
need
someone
lean
is
somebody
what
will
when
get
old
down
same
road
be
there
by
my
side
standing
strong
as
waves
roll
over
nights
are
longing
for
come
home
