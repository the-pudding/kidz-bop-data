me
and
all
my
friends
were
misunderstood
they
say
we
stand
for
nothing
theres
no
way
ever
could
now
see
everything
thats
going
wrong
with
the
world
those
who
lead
it
just
feel
like
dont
have
means
to
rise
above
beat
so
keep
waiting
on
change
its
hard
system
when
standing
at
a
distance
if
had
power
bring
our
neighbors
home
from
war
would
never
missed
christmas
more
ribbons
their
door
but
you
trust
your
television
what
get
is
got
because
own
information
oh
can
bend
want
why
not
that
care
know
fight
isnt
fair
still
waiting
one
day
generation
rule
population
