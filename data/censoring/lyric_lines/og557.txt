in
your
eyes
theres
a
heavy
blue
one
to
love
and
lose
sweet
divine
truth
water
or
wine
dont
make
me
choose
i
wanna
feel
the
way
that
we
did
summer
night
night
drunk
on
feeling
alone
with
stars
sky
ive
been
running
through
jungle
wolves
get
you
you
down
darkest
alleys
saw
dark
side
of
moon
looked
for
love
every
stranger
took
too
much
ease
anger
all
yeah
crying
fingertips
trace
my
skin
places
have
never
blindly
am
following
break
these
walls
come
