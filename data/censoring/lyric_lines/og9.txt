times
get
so
scared
when

about
the
previous
relationship
weve
shared

was
awesome

lost
its
not
possible
for
me
to
care
and

standing
in
rain
nothings
ever
gonna
change
until

vain

games
insecure

know
which
side

theyre
jerks

them
just
know
hurts
wanna
be
with
one
seventh
thing

now

coming
back
taking
steps
