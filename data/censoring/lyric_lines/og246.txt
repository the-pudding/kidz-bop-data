im
so
tired
of
love
songs
songs
just
wanna
go
home
home
whoa
party
trying
my
best
to
meet
somebody
but
everybody
around
me
is
falling
in
our
song
i
oh
yeah
hate
it
taking
a
shot
cause
i
cant
take
it
dont
think
that
they
make
anything
strong
hold
on
strangers
killing
lonely
nights
with
strangers
and
when
leave
back
song
hurts
like
heaven
lost
the
sound
buzz
cut
season
youre
still
unmiss
you
need
now
yeah
someone
home
cause
be
alone
tired
