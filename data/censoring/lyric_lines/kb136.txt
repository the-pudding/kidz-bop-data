im
feeling
happy
and
free
like
glitters
raining
on
me
youre
a
ton
of
pure
gold
i
think
bout
to
explode
can
taste
the
tension
cloud
smoke
in
air
now
breathing
running
cause
taking
there
dont
you
know
spin
out
control
we
dance
here
all
night
done
this
club
up
real
tight
baby
come
bass
drum
sparking
rhythm
rock
world
until
sunlight
make
dream
best
ive
ever
known
were
dancing
moonlight
knock
down
domino
every
second
is
highlight
when
dance
let
go
got
losing
my
mind
heart
beats
time
seeing
hollywood
stars
with
crazy
lights
guitars
