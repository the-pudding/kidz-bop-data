something
happened
for
first
time
deep
inside

was
a
rush

possibility
that
you
would
ever
feel
same
way
about
me

keep
running
from
truth
all
think
is
got
hypnotized
so
mesmerized
and
to
know
when
youre
alone
we
can
be
where
this
thing
go

crazy
or
falling
in
love

crush
catch
breath
look
at
you
are
holding
back
like
do
cause
ive
tried
walk
away
but
crush
aint
going
awayayay
has
crossed
your
mind

hanging
spending

gotta
take
