i
can
almost
see
it
that
dream
im
dreaming
but
theres
a
voice
inside
my
head
saying
"youll
never
reach
it"
every
step
taking
move
make
feels
lost
with
no
direction
faith
is
shaken
i
gotta
keep
trying
held
high
always
gonna
be
another
mountain
wanna
an
uphill
battle
sometimes
have
to
lose
ainâ€™t
about
how
fast
get
there
whats
waiting
on
the
other
side
its
climb
struggles
facing
chances
might
knock
me
down
no
not
breaking
may
know
these
are
moments
remember
most
yeah
just
going
and
strong
pushing
on
cause
youre
moving
climbing
faith
baby
all
about
your
woah-u-oh
