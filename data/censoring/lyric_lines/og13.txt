makin
my
way
downtown
walkin
fast
faces
pass
and
im
homebound
starin
blankly
ahead
just
a
through
the
crowd
i
need
you
miss
now
wonder
if
could
fall
into
sky
do
think
time
would
me
by
cause
know
id
walk
thousand
miles
see
tonight
its
always
times
like
these
when
of
ever
everythings
so
wrong
dont
belong
livin
in
your
precious
memory
ill
oh
i
wanna
let
drown
this
go
still
us
hold
