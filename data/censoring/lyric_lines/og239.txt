i
need
your
love
time
when
everythings
wrong
you
make
it
right
feel
so
high
come
alive
to
be
free
with
tonight
love
take
a
deep
breath
every
pass
door
know
youre
there
but
cant
see
anymore
and
thats
the
reason
in
dark
ive
been
stranger
ever
since
we
fell
apart
helpless
here
watch
my
eyes
are
filled
fear
tell
me
do
same
hold
me
arms
again
now
im
dreaming
will
find
now
walk
circles
ill
never
figure
out
what
mean
you
belong
try
fight
this
not
that
strong
all
years
times
were
blame
open
heart
is
closing
tears
lies
waste
trying
change
