on
a
monday
i
am
waiting
tuesday
fading
and
by
wednesday
cant
sleep
then
the
phone
rings
hear
you
darkness
is
clear
view
cause
youve
come
to
rescue
me
fall
with
fall
so
fast
can
hardly
catch
my
breath
hope
it
lasts
seems
like
finally
rest
head
something
real
way
that
feels
its
as
if
know
better
than
ever
knew
myself
love
how
tell
all
pieces
pieces
of
moody
messy
get
restless
senseless
never
seem
care
when
im
angry
listen
make
happy
your
mission
wont
stop
til
there
sometimes
hit
bottom
crash
youre
have
do
everything
about
say
obvious
written
face
goes
away
yeah
monday
tuesday
into
arms
tell
