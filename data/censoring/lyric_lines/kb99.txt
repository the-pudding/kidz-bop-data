are
we
crazy
living
our
lives
through
a
lens
trapped
in
white
picket
fence
like
ornaments
so
comfortable
were
bubble
bubble
cannot
see
the
trouble
trouble
arent
you
lonely
up
there
utopia
where
nothing
will
ever
be
enough
happily
numb
put
your
rose-colored
glasses
on
and
party
turn
it
up
its
favorite
song
dance
dance
to
distortion
come
on
keep
repeat
stumbling
around
wasted
zombie
yeah
think
free
this
one
is
me
all
chained
rhythm
crazy
tone
deaf
sweeping
under
mat
thought
could
do
better
than
that
i
hope
can
goes
cause
