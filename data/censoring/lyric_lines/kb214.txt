a
hundred
days
have
made
me
older
since
the
last
time
that
i
saw
your
pretty
face
thousand
lies
colder
and
dont
think
can
look
at
this
same
but
all
miles
separate
disappear
now
when
im
dreaming
of
here
without
you
baby
youre
still
on
my
lonely
mind
about
dream
with
in
dreams
tonight
its
only
me
yeah
just
keep
rollin
as
people
leave
their
way
to
say
hello
ive
heard
life
is
overrated
hope
it
gets
better
we
go
oh
girl
everything
know
anywhere
go
hard
wont
take
away
love
one
falls
said
done
love
whoa
