i
can
see
you

with
every
piece
of
dont
underestimate
things
that
will
do
scars

almost
had
it
all
love
breathless
cant
help
feeling
could
have

gonna
wish

me
rolling
deep
tears
are
fall
deep
inside
hand
played
to
beat
baby

told
but
ive
heard
one
on

im
make
head
burn
think
depths
despair
home
down
there
as
mine

through
open
door
ohoh

what
look
for
