been
sitting
eyes
wide
open
behind
these
four
walls
hoping
youd
call
its
just
a
cruel
existence
like
theres
no
point
at
all
baby
baby
i
feel
crazy
up
night
night
and
every
day
give
me
something
or
will
you
say
nothing
what
is
happening
to
me
dont
wanna
live
forever
cause
know
ill
be
living
in
vain
flee
wherever
keep
calling
your
name
until
come
back
home
im
got
one
thing
stuck
my
mind
wondering
if
dodged
problem
lost
the
love
of
life
oh
gave
but
nothing
ive
looking
tired
nicest
places
now
cab
tell
him
where
place
