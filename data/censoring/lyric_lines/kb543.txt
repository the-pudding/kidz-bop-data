ive
been
roaming
around
always
looking
down
at
all
i
see
painted
faces
fill
the
places
cant
reach
you
know
that
could
use
somebody
someone
like
and
how
speak
countless
lovers
under
cover
of
street
off
in
night
while
live
it
up
im
to
sleep
waging
wars
shape
poet
beat
hope
its
gonna
make
notice
me
me
oh
let
out
you
