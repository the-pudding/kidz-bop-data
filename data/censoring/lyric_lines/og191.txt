desperate
for
changing
starving
truth
im
closer
to
where
i
started
chasing
after
you
falling
even
more
in
love
with
letting
go
of
all
ive
held
onto
standing
here
until
make
me
move
hanging
by
a
moment
forgetting
lacking
completely
incomplete
ill
take
your
invitation
now
living
the
only
thing
know
running
and
not
quite
sure
dont
what
diving
into
just
theres
nothing
else
lose
find
world
that
can
change
my
mind
there
is
here
you
