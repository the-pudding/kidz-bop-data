i
can
take
the
rain
on
roof
of
this
empty
house
that
dont
bother
me
a
few
tears
now
and
then
just
let
em
out
im
not
afraid
to
cry
every
once
in
while
even
though
goin
with
you
gon
still
upset
there
are
days
again
pretend
okay
but
thats
what
gets
hurts
most
was
bein
so
close
havin
much
say
watchin
walk
away
never
knowin
couldve
been
seein
lovin
is
tryin
do
its
hard
deal
pain
losin
everywhere
go
doing
it
force
smile
when
see
our
old
friends
alone
harder
gettin
up
dressed
livin
regret
know
if
could
over
would
trade
give
all
words
saved
my
heart
left
unspoken
do
oh
oh
seeing
you
