i
keep
going
to
the
river
pray
cause
need
something
that
can
wash
all
pain
and
at
most
im
sleeping
these
demons
away
but
your
ghost

of
you

keeps
me
awake
my
friends
had
figured
out
yeah
they
saw
whats
inside
tried
hiding
another
evil
was
coming
through
eyes
sitting
on
wall
watch
every
move
make
bright
light
living
in
shade
cold
heart
makes
spirit
shake
go
hell
prove
not
insane
meet
devil
just
know
his
name
thats
when
love
burning
its
still
each
time
think
turn
around
youre
creeping
let
under
skin
sin
boy
never
told
true
hurt
dont
deserve
truth
is
learn
give
up
stop
haunting
baby
