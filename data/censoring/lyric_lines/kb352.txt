i
used
to
be
so
happy
but
without
here
feel
low
watched
you
as
left
can
never
seem
let
go
cause
once
upon
a
time
were
my
everything
its
clear
see
that
hasnt
changed
thing
very
deep
inside
me
theres
something
should
know
ill
forget
youll
always
by
side
from
the
day
met
knew
would
love
till
die
and
will
want
much
more
in
heart
sure
funny
how
we
both
end
seems
alright
ooh
wonder
what
happen
if
went
back
put
up
fight
so
just
do
think
could
ever
take
off
mind
doing
it
loving
it
all
along
had
special
with
sometimes
gotta
these
things
fall
through
im
still
tired
cant
hide
connection
feeling
die
i
never
never
ill
