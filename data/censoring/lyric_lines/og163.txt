be

hide
at
you
holding
my

scared
death

you
inside
feeling
alive
all

again
as

the
sky
under
skin
like
being
love
she

first
time

wherever
i

tonight
feel
world
that
see
waiting
come
life
waking
me
up
dreaming
reality
your
eyes
wrong
but
for
time
time
crashing
into
unknown
lost
this
it
feels
home
sky
thats
