to
memorize
way

felt
hearing
lies
people
that
made
you
cry

so
good
be
bad
not
worth
the
aftermath
after
that
try
get
back
i
still
dont
have
reason
and
time
really
makes
me
wonder
if
ever
gave
a
thought
about
give
something
believe
in
cause
anymore
anymore
even
difference
yeah
this
is
goodbye
cant
stop
my
spinning
head
decisions

now
must
lay
deal
things
ive
left
unsaid
want
dive
into
forget
what
youre
going
through
behind

your
move
truth
try
yeah

how
feelin
but
its
true

here
before
one
day
