one
kiss
is
all
it
takes
fallin
in
love
with
me
possibilities
i
look
like
you
need
let
take
the
night
real
easy
and
know
that
youll
still
wanna
see
on
sunday
morning
music
loud
while
moon
out
something
you-ou-ou
lit
up
heaven
me-e-e
feeling
wont
slee-ee-eep
cause
im
lost
way
move
feel
just
your
skin
mine
eyes
do
exploring
passion
message
when
smile
my
time
a
wonderland
might
company
tonight
