since
the
moment
i
spotted
you
like
walking
around
with
little
wings
on
my
shoes
stomachs
filled
butterflies
and
its
alright
bouncing
round
from
cloud
to
got
feeling
im
never
gonna
come
down
if
said
didnt
it
then
youd
know
id
lie
every
time
try
talk
get
tongue-tied
turns
out
that
everything
say
comes
wrong
right
so
why
dont
together
take
world
be
forever
heads
we
will
tails
well
again
hold
each
other
fly
moon
straight
heaven
cause
without
theyre
let
me
in
whens
this
fever
break
think
ive
handled
more
than
any
man
can
a
love
sick
puppy
chasing
slowly
begin
realize
is
end
but
about
same
walk
by
say
"oh
here
go
again
oh"
