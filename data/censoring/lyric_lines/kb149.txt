and
another
one
bites
the
dust
oh
why
can
i
not
conquer
love
might
have thought that
we
were one
wanted
to
fight
this
war
without weapons
it
it
bad
but
there
were
so
many
red
flags
now
yeah
lets
be
clear
ill
trust
no
you
did
break
me
im
still
fighting
for
peace
ive
got
thick
skin
an
elastic
heart
your
blade
too
sharp
like
a
rubber
band
until
pull
hard
may
snap
move
fast
wont
see
fall
apart
cause
will
stay
up
through
night
close
my
eyes
know
that
survive
walk
away
save
life
want
doing
everything
then
its
lose
chosen
