i
walk
a
lonely
road
the
only
that
have
ever
known
dont
know
where
it
goes
but
its
home
to
me
and
alone
this
empty
street
on
boulevard
of
broken
dreams
city
sleeps
im
one
unverified
my
shadows
walks
beside
shallow
hearts
thing
thats
beating
sometimes
wish
some
out
there
will
find
till
then
ah
ah
walking
down
line
divides
somewhere
in
mind
border
edge
read
between
lines
whats
messed
up
everythings
all
right
check
vital
signs
still
alive
someone
when
