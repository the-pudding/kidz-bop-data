lets
go
back
back
to
the
beginning
when
earth
sun
stars
all
aligned
cause
perfect
didnt
feel
so
trying
fit
a
square
into
circle
was
no
life
i
defy
let
rain
fall
down
and
wake
my
dreams
it
wash
away
sanity
wanna
thunder
scream
im
coming
clean
clean
oh
shedding
shedding
every
color
tryna
find
pigment
of
truth
beneath
skin
different
doesnt
going
out
is
better
than
always
staying
in
wind
lets
beginning
rain
down
fall
let
dreams
oh
sanity
oh-oh
