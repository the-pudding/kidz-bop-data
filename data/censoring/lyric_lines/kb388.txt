loving
can
hurt
sometimes
but
its
the
only
thing
that
i
know
when
it
gets hard
you know
can get
hard
is
only thing
makes
us
feel
alive
we
keep
this
love
in
a
photograph
made
these
memories
for
ourselves
where
our
eyes
are
never
closing
hearts
broken
times
forever
frozen
still
so
you
me
inside
pocket
of
your
ripped
jeans
holdin
closer
til
meet
wont
ever
be
alone
wait
to
come
home
heal
mend
soul
and
know
swear
will
get
easier
remember
with
every
piece
ya
take
go
were
if
thats
okay
baby
words
bleed
pages
just
hold
let
oh
fit
necklace
got
13
next
heartbeat
should
deep
within
well
ok
im
away
how
kissed
under
lamppost
back
on
sixth
street
hearing
whisper
through
phone
