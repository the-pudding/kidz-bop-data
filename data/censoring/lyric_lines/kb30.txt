here
we
go
again
i
kinda
wanna
be
more
than
friends
so
take
it
easy
on
me
im
afraid
youre
never
satisfied
were
sick
like
animals
play
pretend
just
a
cannibal
and
wont
get
out
alive
no
sleep
tonight
oh
want
some
what
are
you
waiting
for
bite
of
my
heart
say
goodbye
to
feel
the
chemicals
kicking
in
its
getting
heavy
run
hide
do
every
time
losing
me
now
denied
by
you
animal
inside
hush
world
is
quiet
both
cant
fight
us
that
made
this
mess
why
understand
whoa
again
waiting
oh
