my
eyes
are
open
wide
by
the
way
i
made
it
through
day
watched
world
outside
im
leaving
out
today
well
just
saw
halleys
comet
she
waved
said
"why
you
always
running
in
place"
even
man
moon
disappeared
somewhere
stratosphere
tell
mother
father
ive
done
best
can
to
make
them
realize
this
is
life
hope
they
understand
not
angry
saying
sometimes
goodbye
a
second
chance
please
dont
cry
one
tear
for
me
afraid
of
what
have
say
and
only
voice
so
listen
close
its
heres
