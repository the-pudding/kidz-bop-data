ive
been
staring
at
the
edge
of
water
long
as
i
can
remember
never
really
knowing
why
wish
could
be
perfect
daughter
but
come
back
to
water
no
matter
how
hard
try
every
turn
take
trail
track
path
make
road
leads
place
know
where
cannot
go
see
line
sky
meets
sea
it
calls
me
and
one
knows
far
goes
if
wind
in
my
sail
on
sea
stays
behind
day
ill
theres
just
telling
everybody
this
island
seems
so
happy
everything
is
by
design
has
a
role
maybe
roll
with
mine
lead
pride
make
us
strong
satisfied
play
along
voice
inside
sings
different
song
what
wrong
me
light
shines
its
blinding
deep
like
calling
out
me
find
let
whats
beyond
that
line
will
cross
line
