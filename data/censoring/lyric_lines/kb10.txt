the
problem

im
in
love

about
it
every
time
cant
stop
thinkin
bout
how
much
longer
will
take
to
cure
this
just
cause
ignore
if

makes
me
wanna
turn
around
and

on
a
little
faster
world
follow
after
everybodys
snowball
runnin
down
into
spring
thats
comin
all
this
meltin
under
blue
skies
beltin
out
sunlight
shimmering
baby
surrender
strawberry
ice
cream
never
ever
end
of
love
didnt
mean

theres
no
escapin
your
these
lines
lightning
were
alone
no
move
closer
hear
you
whisper
settle
inside
my
jump
higher
feel
lighter
we
were
once
upon
time
accidentally
spin
tighter
on
worlds
brighter
get
yourself
her
