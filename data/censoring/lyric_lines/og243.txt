thought
love
was
only
true
in
fairy
tales
meant
for
someone
else
but
not
me
out
to
get

the
way
it
seemed
disappointment
haunted
all
my
dreams
and
then
saw
her
face
now
im
a
believer
trace
of
doubt
mind
couldnt
leave
if
tried
more
or
less
given
thing
gave
got
oh
yeah
whats
use
trying
you
is
pain
when
wanted
sunshine
got
rain
