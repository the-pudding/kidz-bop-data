this
is
the
story
of
a
girl
who
cried
river
and
drowned
whole
world!
while
she
looked
so
sad
in
photographs
i
absolutely
love
her
when
smiles
how
many
days
year
woke
up
with
hope
but
only
found
tears
can
be
insincere
making
promises
never
for
real!
as
long
stands
there
waiting
wearing
holes
soles
shoes!
disappear
you
look
mirror
do
choose
your
clothes
wear
well
next
day
hair
falls
quite
same
way
seem
to
run
out
things
say
lovers
would
stay
just
put
shit
after
day!
did
we
wind
way
watching
our
mouths
words
that
say
stand
here
souls
choose!
get
today
were
walking
far
price
say!
looks
her
girl;
pretty
face
hid
from
lonely

girl!
smiles
