i
never
came
to
the
beach
or
stood
by
ocean
sat
shore
under
sun
with
my
feet
in
sand
but
you
brought
me
here
and
im
happy
that
did
cause
now
as
free
birds
catchin
wind
always
thought
would
sink
so
swam
went
boatin
dont
get
how
they
are
floatin
sometimes
scared
of
what
cant
understand
here
am
next
skys
more
blue
malibu
we
watched
go
down
were
walkin
id
spent
rest
life
just
standing
talkin
explain
current
smile
hoping
youll
stay
same
nothing
will
change
itll
be
us
for
a
while
do
even
exist
thats
when
make
wish
swim
away
fish
cause
its
supposed
this
hot
all
summer
long
wouldve
believed
if
three
years
ago
told
writing
song
like
waves
flow
back
forth
feel
drowning
youre
there
save
wanna
thank
heart
brand
new
start
dream
come
true
