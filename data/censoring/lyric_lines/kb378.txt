looking
at
it
now
all
seems
so
simple
we
were
sitting
on
your
couch
i
remember
you
took
a
polaroid
of
us
then
discovered
then
discovered
the
rest
world
was
black
and
white
but
in
screaming
color
thinking
are
out
woods
yet
woods
clear
good
world
last
december
last
december
built
to
fall
apart
back
together
back
together
necklace
hanging
from
my
neck
night
couldnt
quite
forget
when
decided
we
decided
move
furniture
could
dance
baby
like
stood
chance
two
paper
airplanes
flying
flying
hit
brakes
too
soon
20
stitches
hospital
room
started
crying
did
sun
came
up
take
heat
walked
said
im
setting
free
monsters
turned
be
just
trees
me
me
ooh
remember
oh
