paper
bags
and
plastic
hearts
all
are
belongings
in
shopping
carts
its
goodbye
but
we
got
one
more
night
lets
get
drunk
ride
around
make
peace
with
an
empty
town
can
it
right
throw
away
forget
yesterday
well
the
great
escape
wont
hear
a
word
they
say
dont
know
us
anyway
watch
burn
let
die
cause
finally
free
tonight
will
change
our
lives
so
good
to
be
by
your
side
cry
give
up
fight
scream
loud
at
top
of
lungs
theyll
think
just
were
young
feel
alive
wasted
time
hours
that
were
left
behind
me
answers
never
find
mean
thing
