i
had
a
dream
you
were
hanging
out
with
me
highest
floor
the
bowery
nowheres
far
enough
somewhere
along
lines
we
stopped
seeing
eye
to
staying
at
night
and
no
dont
wanna
know
where
youve
been
or
youre
going
but
it
wont
be
home
youll
on
your
own
whos
gonna
walk
through
dark
side
of
morning
help
when
sun
let
sleep
waking
up
take
all
alone
aint
seventeen
summer
nights
libertines
never
growing
ill
polaroids
memories
im
leave
behind
worst
us
no
no
