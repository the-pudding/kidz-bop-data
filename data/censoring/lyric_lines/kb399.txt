three
little
birds
sat
on
my
window
and
they
told
me
i
dont
need
to
worry
summer
came
like
cinnamon
so
sweet
girls
double
dutch
the
concrete
maybe
sometimes
we
get
it
wrong
but
its
alright
more
things
seem
change
stay
same
you
hesitate
girl
put
your
records
on
tell
favorite
song
go
ahead
let
hair
down
sapphire
faded
jeans
hope
dreams
just
youre
gonna
find
yourself
somewhere
somehow
blue
as
sky
somebody
lonely
sipping
tea
in
bar
by
roadside
relax
relax
those
other
boys
fool
got
love
that
afro
hairdo
feel
afraid
think
strange
than
could
take
pity
for
pitys
sake
some
nights
kept
awake
thought
was
stronger
when
realize
even
have
try
any
longer
do
what
want
ooh
