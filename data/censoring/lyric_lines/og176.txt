the
pills
on
table
for
your
unrequited
love
would
be
nothing
without
you
holding
me
up
now
im
strong
enough
both
of
us

am
giant
ooh
stand
my
shoulders
tell

cause
well
breaking
boulders
underneath
our
feet
am
oh
dont
hide
emotions
can
throw
down
guard
and
feed
from
notion
we
who
are
taught
something
yeah
freedom
is
ours
living
togetherness
togetherness
boulders
oh
hey-oh
hey-oh
gonna
shake
away
in
dirt
under
me
yeah
dirt
all
way
