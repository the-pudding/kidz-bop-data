i
hope
the
ring
you
gave
to
her
turns
finger
green
that
when
youre
out
with
think
of
me
would
never
wish
bad
things
but
dont
well
could
tell
by
flames
burned
your
word
read
letter
cause
knew
what
youd
say
give
sunday
school
answer
try
and
make
it
all
okay
does
hurt
know
ill
be
there
bet
hurts
see
my
face
everywhere
was
who
chose
end
like
did
last
knew
exactly
do
simply
lost
way
she
may
believe
but
will
again
if
really
knows
truth
deserves
a
trophy
girl
oh
how
cute
ignorance
is
bliss
day
comes
hes
through
you
hell
youll
together
alone
wrote
in
couldnt
right
repent
yourself
away
hear
miss
fall
kiss
want
love
