been
there
done
that
messed
around
i’m
having
fun
don’t
put
me
down
i’ll
never
let
you
sweep
off
my
feet
i
won’t
in
again
the
messages
i’ve
tried
to
send
information’s
just
not
going
burnin’
bridges
shore
break
away
from
something
more
turned
on
love
until
it’s
cheap
this
time
baby
be
bulletproof
turn
and
tell
now
much
too
proud
walk
when
dead
do
do
your
dirty
words
come
out
play
are
hurt
there’s
certain
things
that
should
left
unsaid
tick
tick
watch
life’s
short
for
stop
oh
time
is
running
all
fill
up
with
doubt
