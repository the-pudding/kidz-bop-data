i
thought
that
ive
been
hurt
before
but
no
ones
ever
left
me
quite
this
sore
your
words
cut
deeper
than
a
knife
now
need
someone
to
breathe
back
life
got
feeling
im
going
under
know
ill
make
it
out
alive
if
quit
calling
you
my
other
move
on
watch
run
until
cant
breathe
shaking
falling
onto
knees
and
without
kisses
be
needing
stitches
tripping
over
myself
aching
begging
come
help
just
like
moth
drawn
flame
oh
pulled
in
couldnt
sense
the
pain
beating
heart
cold
touch
gonna
reap
what
sow
seeing
own
lover
needle
thread
gotta
get
of
head
wind
up
dead
bleed
