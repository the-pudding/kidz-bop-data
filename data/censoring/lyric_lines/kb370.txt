hurry
up
and
wait
so
close
but
far
away
everything
that
youve
always
dreamed
of
enough
for
you
to
taste
just
cant
touch
wanna
show
the
world
no
one
knows
your
name
yet
wonder
when
where
youre
gonna
make
it
know
can
if
get
chance
in
face
door
keeps
slamming
now
feeling
more
frustrated
getting
all
kind
impatient
waiting
we
live
learn
take
step
at
a
time
theres
need
rush
its
like
learning
fly
or
falling
love
happen
supposed
find
reasons
why
time
believe
doubt
confused
got
figured
out
wished
could
be
yours
should
would
yours
they
only
knew
wait
any
longer
end
sight
faith
makes
stronger
way
there
is
