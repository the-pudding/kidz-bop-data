ive
had
a
bad
day
and
nothing
ever
seems
to
go
my
way
got
heartache
dont
wanna
think
about
it
every
time
i
try
smile
cry
so
ill
just
hide
face
get
out
of
talk
be
fine
need
some
im
hanging
on
today
nothings
gonna
stop
me
anyway
holding
strong
the
only
one
who
can
make
change
fight
gotta
live
life
alright
me
went
wrong
but
not
lost
its
good
mistake
saw
break
shout
oh
turn
around
find
that
alone
again
laugh
when
feel
lonely
like
floating
is
real
above
all
