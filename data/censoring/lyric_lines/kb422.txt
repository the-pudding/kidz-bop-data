i
met
you
in
the
dark
lit
me
up
made
feel
as
though
was
enough
we
danced
night
away
sang
so
much
held
your
hand
that
way
were
singing
oh
then
smiled
over
shoulder
for
a
minute
feeling
older
said
thought
best
and
asked
to
stand
closer
said
already
told
ya
think
should
get
some
rest
knew
loved
but
youd
never
know
cause
played
it
cool
when
scared
of
letting
go
needed
showed
wanna
stay
with
until
were
grey
old
just
say
wont
let
looked
forget
im
dance
right
now
look
beautiful
ever
swear
everyday
youll
better
make
this
somehow
love
hope
darling
is
more
than
worth
its
weight
gold
weve
come
far
my
dear
how
grown
live
even
ghosts
always
there
most
gonna
till
lungs
give
out
promise
death
part
like
our
vows
wrote
song
now
everybody
knows
its
oh
