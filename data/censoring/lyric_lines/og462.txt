wait
till
youre
announced
weve
not
yet
lost
all
our
graces
the
hounds
will
stay
in
chains
look
upon
your
greatness
and
shell
send
call
out
ladies
out
theyre
their
finery
a
hundred
jewels
on
throats
between
teeth
now
bring
my
boys
in
skin
craters
like
moon
we
love
brother
while
he
glows
through
room
dancin
around
lies
tell
big
eyes
as
well
even
comatose
they
dont
dance
live
cities
youll
never
see
onscreen
very
pretty
but
sure
know
how
to
run
things
livin
ruins
of
palace
within
dreams
you
were
each
others
team
im
kind
over
gettin
told
throw
hands
up
air
so
there
cups
got
broke
shards
beneath
feet
it
wasnt
fault
everyones
competing
for
wont
receive
cause
what
this
wants
is
release
older
than
i
was
when
reveled
without
care
know
