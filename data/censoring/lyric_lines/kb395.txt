well
you
almost
had
me
fooled
told
that
i
was
nothing
without
oh
and
after
everything
youve
done
can
thank
for
how
strong
have
become
cause
brought
the
flames
know
it
too
well
to
learn
fight
myself
we
both
all
truth
could
tell
ill
just
say
this
is
wish
farewell
hope
youre
somewhere
prayin
prayin
your
soul
changin
changin
find
peace
falling
on
knees
im
proud
of
who
am
no
more
monsters
breathe
again
said
were
wrong
now
best
yet
come
