i
got
this
feeling
on
the
summer
day
when
you
were
gone
crashed
my
car
into
bridge
watched
let
it
burn
threw
your
shit
a
bag
and
pushed
down
stairs
dont
care!
love
it
youre
different
road
im
in
milky
way
want
me
earth
but
am
up
space
so
damn
hard
to
please
we
gotta
kill
switch
from
70s
90s
bitch
it!
