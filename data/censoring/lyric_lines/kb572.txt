theres
another
world
inside
of
me
that
you
may
never
see
secrets
in
this
life
i
cant
hide
somewhere
darkness
a
light
find
maybe
its
too
far
away
im
just
blind
so
hold
when
here
right
wrong
scared
and
love
gone
everything
am
wants
to
be
the
one
wanted
ill
let
down
even
if
could
id
give
up
only
for
your
good
can
wont
always
there
gone
education
x-ray
cannot
under
my
skin
tell
damn
thing
not
friends
roaming
through
alive
but
alone
part
is
fighting
scared
whoa
