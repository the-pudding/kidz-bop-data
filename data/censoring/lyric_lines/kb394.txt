eh-eh-o
eh-o
i
was
left
to
my
own
devices
many
days
fell
away
with
nothing
show
and
the
walls
kept
tumbling
down
in
city
that
we
love
grey
clouds
roll
over
hills
bringing
darkness
from
above
but
if
you
close
your
eyes
does
it
almost
feel
like
changed
at
all
youve
been
here
before
how
am
gonna
be
an
optimist
about
this
were
caught
up
lost
all
of
our
vices
pose
as
dust
settles
around
us
oh
where
do
begin
rubble
or
sins
