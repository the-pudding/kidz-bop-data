go
ahead
as
you
waste
your
days
with
thinking
when
fall
everyone
stands
another
day
and
youve
had
fill
of
sinking
the
life
held
in
hands
are
shaking
cold
these
meant
to
hold
speak
me
all
got
keep
is
strong
move
along
along
like
i
know
ya
do
even
hope
gone
just
make
it
through
so
a
lost
yourself
completely
could
be
night
ends
such
heart
that
will
lead
deceiving
pain
mine
go
on
on
everything
wrong
we
along
just
through
like
do
right
back
what
wrong
