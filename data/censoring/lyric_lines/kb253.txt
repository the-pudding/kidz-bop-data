hope
when
you
take
that
jump
dont
fear
the
fall
water
rises
built
a
wall
crowd
screams
out
theyre
screaming
your
name
if
everybody
runs
choose
to
stay
in
love
and
it
hurts
so
bad
only
way
can
know
is
give
all
have
i
suffer
but
pain
moment
comes
youll
say
i
did
owned
every
second
this
world
could
saw
many
places
things
with
broken
bone
swear
lived
spend
days
they
add
up
sun
goes
down
raise
cup
oh
wish
witness
joy
until
my
ill
oh
i
lived
ohhh
