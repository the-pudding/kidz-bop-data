do
you
ever
feel
like
a
plastic
bag
drifting
through
the
wind
wanting
to
start
again
feel
so
paperthin
house
of
cards
one
blow
from
caving
in
already
buried
deep
six
feet
under
screams
but
no
seems
hear
thing
know
that
theres
still
chance
for
you
cause
spark
in
just
gotta
ignite
light
and
let
it
shine
own
night
fourth
july
baby
youre
firework
come
on
show
em
what
worth
make
go
"aah
aah
aah"
as
shoot
across
sky
on
your
colors
burst
gonna
leave
them
all
awe
awe
dont
have
waste
space
original
cannot
be
replaced
if
only
knew
future
holds
after
hurricane
comes
rainbow
maybe
reason
why
doors
are
closed
could
open
leads
perfect
road
lightning
bolt
heart
will
glow
when
its
time
youll
boom
boom
even
brighter
than
moon
moon
always
been
inside
you
now
time
