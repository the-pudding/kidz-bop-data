i
heard
that
youre
settled
down
you
found
a
girl
and
happy
now
your
dreams
came
true
guess
she
gave
things
didnt
give
to
old
friend
why
are
so
shy
aint
like
hold
back
or
hide
from
the
light
hate
turn
up
out
of
blue
uninvited
but
couldnt
stay
away
fight
it
had
hoped
youd
see
my
face
be
reminded
for
me
isnt
over
chorus
never
mind
ill
find
someone
wish
nothing
best
you
too
dont
forget
begged
remember
said
sometimes
lasts
in
love
hurts
instead
know
how
time
flies
only
yesterday
was
our
lives
we
were
born
raised
summer
haze
bound
by
surprise
glory
days
yet
compares
no
worries
cares
regrets
mistakes
theyre
memories
made
who
would
have
known
bittersweet
this
taste
x2
