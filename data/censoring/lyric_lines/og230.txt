sitting
eyes
wide
open
behind
these
four
walls
hoping
youd
call
its
just
a
cruel
existence
like
no
point
at
all
baby
i
feel
crazy
up
night
night
and
every
day
give
me
something
oh
but
you
say
nothing
what
is
happening
to
me
dont
wanna
live
forever
cause
know
ill
be
living
in
vain
fit
wherever
keep
calling
your
name
until
come
back
home
im
got
one
thing
stuck
my
mind
wondering
if
dodged
bullet
or
lost
the
love
of
life
gave
fit
babe
wherever
ive
looking
sad
nicest
places
see
around
empty
faces
now
