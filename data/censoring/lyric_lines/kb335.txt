arent
you
somethin
to
admire
cause
your
shine
is
like
a
mirror
and
i
cant
help
but
notice
reflect
in
this
heart
of
mine
if
ever
feel
alone
the
glare
makes
me
hard
find
just
know
that
im
always
parallel
on
other
side
with
hand
my
pocket
full
soul
can
tell
theres
no
place
we
couldnt
go
put
glass
ill
be
tryin
pull
through
gotta
strong
dont
wanna
lose
now
lookin
right
at
half
vacancy
sat
space
hold
show
how
fight
for
you
baby
it
was
easy
comin
back
here
once
figured
out
were
all
along
its
youre
staring
get
any
bigger
anyone
else
beside
clear
as
promise
were
making
two
reflections
into
one
me
somethin
an
original
doesnt
seem
merely
sample
stare
see
truth
somewhere
eyes
change
without
love
about
could
would
look
us
time
yesterday
history
tomorrows
mystery
keep
please
baby
