somewhere
theres
speaking
its
already
coming
in
oh
and
rising
at
the
back
of
your
mind
you
never
could
get
it
unless
were
fed
now
youre
here
dont
know
why
but
under
skinned
knees
skid
marks
past
places
where
used
to
learn
howl
listen
wait
for
echoes
angels
who
wont
return
hes
everything
want
need
inside
that
wish
be
he
says
all
right
things
exactly
time
means
nothing
waiting
someone
put
together
push
away
always
another
wound
discover
something
more
hed
say
youll
just
sit
tight
watch
unwind
only
what
asking
fine
with
out
island
into
highway
might
have
turned
did
notice
still
hide
anger
i
am
mean
