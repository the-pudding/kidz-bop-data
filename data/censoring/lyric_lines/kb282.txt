shes
cold
and
cruel
but
she
knows
what
doin
pushed
me
in
the
pool
at
our
last
school
reunion
laughs
my
dreams
i
dream
about
her
laughter
strange
as
it
seems
one
im
after
cause
bittersweet
knocks
off
feet
cant
help
myself
dont
want
anyone
else
a
mystery
too
much
for
keep
coming
back
more
just
girl
looking
secret
than
an
hour
runs
on
100%
attitude
power
ignores
adore
can
do
id
anything
way
see
its
caller
id
wont
pick
up
phone
rather
be
alone
give
yet
because
every
word
said
still
ringing
head
to
say
so
whole
day
is
ruined
oh
