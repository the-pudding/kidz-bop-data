she
just
wants
to
be
beautiful
goes
unnoticed
knows
no
limits
craves
attention
she praises an
image
prays to
sculpted
by
the
sculptor
oh she
dont
see
light
thats
shining
deeper
than
eyes
can
find
it
maybe
we
have
made
her
blind
so
tries
cover
up
pain
and
hold
woes
away
cause
girls
cry
after
their
face
is
but
theres
a
hope
waiting
for
you
in
dark
should
know
youre
way
are
change
thing
world
could
its
heart
scars
your
beautiful
were
stars
ohoh
ohoh
perfect
understand
shes
worth
or
that
beauty
surface
oh
oh
all
hurting
let
me
mirror
help
little
bit
clearer
shines
within
better
no
are
life
living
living
time
shine
star
