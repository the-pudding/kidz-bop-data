now
that
its
all
said
and
done
i
cant
believe
you
were
the
one
to
build
me
up
tear
down
like
an
old
abandoned
house
what
when
left
just
cold
out
of
breath
felt
if
was
in
way
too
deep
guess
let
get
best
well
never
saw
it
coming
should
have
started
running
long
long
time
ago
thought
id
doubt
im
better
off
without
more
than
you
know
slowly
getting
closure
really
over
finally
picking
pieces
spending
these
years
putting
my
heart
back
together
day
through
got
took
a
hammer
walls
dragged
memories
hall
packed
your
bags
walked
away
there
nothing
could
say
slammed
front
door
shut
lot
others
opened
so
did
eyes
see
for
whoa
cause
