he
said
lets
get
out
of
this
town
drive
the
city
away
from
crowds
i
thought
heaven
cant
help
me
now
nothing
lasts
forever
but
is
gonna
take
down
hes
so
tall
and
handsome
as
well
good
knows
it
too
can
see
end
begins
my
one
condition
say
youll
remember
standing
in
a
nice
dress
staring
at
sunset
babe
red
lips
rosy
cheeks
again
even
if
its
just
your
wildest
dreams
oh

ah
no
what
we
went
through
his
hands
are
air
looks
across
room
voice
familiar
sound
getting
when
weve
had
our
very
last
kiss
request
dress
e
you
hindsight
hanging
with
all
night
turning
down
some
day
leave
bet
these
memories
follow
follow
around
pretend
just
pretend
pretend
ah
oh
oh
