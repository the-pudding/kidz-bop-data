written
in
these
walls
are
the
stories
that
i
cant
explain
leave
my
heart
open
but
it
stays
right
here
empty
for
days
she
told
me
morning
dont
feel
same
about
us
her
bones
seems
to
when
die
words
will
be
on
stone
and
ill
gone
gone
tonight
ground
beneath
feet
is
wide
way
ive
been
holding
too
tight
with
nothing
between
story
of
life
take
home
drive
all
night
keep
warm
time
frozen
give
hope
spend
love
until
shes
broke
inside
colours
change
its
cage
know
morning
now
see
light
up
hill
although
am
broken
untamed
still
fire
burning
bright
so
waiting
this
come
around
but
baby
running
after
you
like
chasing
clouds
give
hope
until
inside
