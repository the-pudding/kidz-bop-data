i
keep
fighting
voices
in
my
mind
that
say
im
not
enough
every
single
lie
tells
me
will
never
measure
up
am
more
than
just
the
sum
of
high
and
low
remind
once
again
who
am
because
need
to
know
you
loved
when
cant
feel
a
thing
strong
think
weak
held
falling
short
dont
belong
yours
believe
believe
what
only
matters
now
is
everything
you
find
worth;
identity
taking
all
have
im
laying
it
at
your
feet
failure
god
youll
victory
oh
yes
