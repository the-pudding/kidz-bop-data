shaking
off
the
rust
ive
got
my
heart
set
on
anywhere
but
here
staring
down
myself
counting
up
years
steady
hands
just
take
wheel
and
every
glance
hurting
me
one
last
appeal
for
life
lead
stop
stare
moving
go
no
where
yeah
know
that
everyone
gets
scared
become
what
cant
be
oh
you
start
wonder
why
youre
not
there
youd
give
anything
get
whats
fair
aint
really
need
oh
can
see
see
theyre
trying
come
back
all
senses
push
untie
weight
bags
never
thought
could
feet
dont
fail
gonna
run
till
walk
something
pulls
focus
out
standing
be
do
